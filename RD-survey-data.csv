As a reminder, we have included the definition of research development from the National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP) below. We have also included some examples of day-to-day activities in which Research Development (RD) professionals engage.



Research Development (RD) encompasses a set of strategic, catalytic, and capacity-building activities that advance research, especially in higher education. Research Development professionals help researchers become more successful communicators, grant writers, and advocates for their research. They help researchers bring new ideas to life.



Examples of day-to-day activities of a RD professional:

	Meeting with researchers to discuss how their work aligns with current funding opportunities
	Organizing networking and team-building events in response to new funding opportunities
	Building and maintaining relationships with community organizations and industry partners
	Connecting disparate groups on campus to share tools and resources for research and proposal development
	Helping researchers develop business plans to commercialize research products


With this definition and the examples in mind, please tell us how familiar you are with careers in Research Development.",Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,And how interested are you in Research Development as a career?,"If you would like, please tell us a little more about your familiarity and interest in Research Development careers.

While they may be helpful for some groups, they have only caused problems when I have worked with them. Communicating science and using relevant advances in business to help and inform taxpayers that ultimately pay for the research is incredibly important but research development does not need to reach into all components of research.

I'm generally in favor of anything that improves our ability to conduct research and communicate more effectively about it. I've heard of people who specialize in scientific communication, and I've seen team building activities, and in that sense I'm very in favor of this field, whether I knew they were called research development careers or not. I think there are a lot of practical skills that should be taught to graduate students and researchers that aren't currently a major focus, but I would've expected that to be called things like project management and science communication or something. Research development sounds like just the initial stages of research (figuring out how you get data and resources, maybe idea brainstorming, etc.). I wouldn't have linked the example tasks you listed to the description of something called a ""Research Development career"". 
Also, while I doubt this is the focus of the career path or the people organizing this, one of your descriptions was along the lines of aligning current research interests with current funding opportunities or something. That's an important thing, but in the current political climate all I can think of is aligning research to the current administration's interest, because that's how I'm usually seeing that phrase used. That is also an important thing for anyone who wants to work with government funding in the US, but it's also a very uncomfortable thing given how it's negatively impacted research (including my own). So seeing that phrasing brings on a bit of an instinctual cringe from me. "
