# Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics
Recall the differences between descriptive and inferential statistics:

This week, we will focus on **inferential statistics**.

# Inferential Statistics {.tabset .tabset-fade}
This week, we will discuss three common inferential statistical tests:

1. Chi-square ($\chi^2$) test of independence
2. Independent samples *t*-test
3. Pearson's correlation (also known simply as a correlation)

Before doing so, we need to know how some terms used to discuss hypothesis testing and how to conduct hypothesis testing.

## Important Terms

- **Null hypothesis ($H_0$)**: A prediction that states there is **no relationship** between the variables of interest.
- **Alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)**: The opposite of $H_0$. This is a prediction that states there **is a relationship** between he variables of interest.

## Steps in Hypothesis Testing
When conducting hypothesis tests, we use the following steps in the order listed:

1. State null ($H_0$) and alternative ($H_a$) hypotheses.
2. Set the level of significant (also known as alpha ($\alpha$); usually $\alpha = 0.05$).
3. Calculate the test statistic, which will differ depending on the hypothesis test you use.

| Hypothesis Test | Test Statistic |
|:---|:---:|
| Independent samples *t*-test | $t$ |
| Chi-square test of independence | $\chi^2$ |
| Pearson's correlation | Pearson's $r$ |

4. Determine $p$-value. The $p$-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic assuming your null hypothesis is supported. Another way to phrase this is the $p$-value is the probability of obtaining the results you did (or more extreme results) given that $H_0$ is true.
5. Compare $p$-value to $\alpha$.
   - If $p \leq \alpha$, we **reject** the null hypothesis ($H_0$).
   - If $p > \alpha$, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis ($H_0$).

Using hypothesis testing, researchers typically hope to "nullify" their null hypothesis ($H_0$) since we are typically trying to shed more light on relationships between variables.

The video below walks through an example of how to conduct a hypothesis test.

# Errors in Hypothesis Testing {.tabset .tabset-fade}
When conducting hypothesis tests, 2 types of errors can occur. These are **Type I** and **Type II errors**. The table below provides an explanation and an easy way to remember the types of errors that can occur during hypothesis testing.
