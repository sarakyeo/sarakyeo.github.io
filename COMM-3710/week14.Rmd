We will use the following journal article as an example:

> Yeo, S. K., Su, L. Y.-F., Cacciatore, M. A., McKasy, M., & Qian, S. (2020). Predicting intentions to engage with scientific messages on Twitter: The roles of mirth and need for humor. Science Communication, 42(4), 481â€“507. https://doi.org/10.1177/1075547020942512

Of course, your presentation should always include a descriptive title and the authors' names.
