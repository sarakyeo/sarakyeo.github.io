# Why Statistics?

Statistics is a way of...

- organizing,
- describing,
- and making inferences from or interpreting data.

Statistics is fundamental to scientific processes. As you grow accustomed and practiced at thinking *statistically*, you will find yourself interpreting and evaluating claims that people make more analytically and critically.

Sometimes math anxiety can interfere with the goal of conceptual understanding of statisticsâ€”this is based on the belief that stats is about numbers and math. But, statistics is not solely about math and numbers.

> Statistics is not just numbers; it is a language by which we can communicate empirical evidence.

Before we dive in, let's look at some examples of data and statistics in media and everyday life, and how they are useful in many jobs and careers.

# A Digression: Data and Statistics in Media and Everyday Life

In today's media environment, data are used in a myriad of ways. We see data-driven reporting on everything from politics to sports. Such data journalism has become prevalent in the online media environment and some familiarity with the statistics and tools used in this area is vital.

Explore some of the links below and how statistics is used in each of these domains:

- [Science and engineering indicators in the US](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20207)
- [Politics: The 2020 election forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/)
- [Baseball (Moneyball, anyone?)](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-mlb/#)
- [Basketball](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/#cavaliers)
- [NFL football](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nfls-most-run-heavy-and-pass-happy-teams/)

Although most employers would like you to be familiar with basic statistics and statistical tools, they do not expect you will be an expert in data analysis or statistics! Often, having advanced data analysis skills is an advantage.

Data and statistics are also widely used in journalism. Read this [article (contains an embedded video)](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/news-media/research-chat-new-york-times-sarah-cohen-state-data-journalism-what-reporters-need-know/) about the state of data journalism. It reports an interview with [Sarah Cohen](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/3189494), a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Professor who holds the Knight Chair in Journalism at Arizona State University.

But journalism is, of course, not the only job in which statistics and data are useful...

# The Benefit of Statistics

For communication researchers, the primary benefits of statistics are as tools to describe, organize, and interpret information. 

The ability of statistics to **describe**, **summarize**, and **organize data** in meaningful ways is extremely useful. We live in a world that is inundated with lots of information. For example, the [U.S. Census](https://data.census.gov/) collects data from households around the country and estimates that the total population of Utah (in 2020) is 3,271,616. The table below shows population data for states in the western U.S.

Statistics such as these allow us to easily answer questions like: **What percentage of the U.S. population that lives in Utah?**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)

State <- c("USA", "Arizona", "California", "Colorado", "Idaho", "Montana",
           "Nevada", "New Mexico", "Oregon", "Utah", "Wyoming")
Pop <- c(334735155, 7151502, 39538223, 5773714, 1839106, 1084225,
         3104614, 2117522, 4237256, 3271616, 576851)

censusdata <- tibble(State, Pop)
censusdata %>% 
  kbl(., format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable_classic_2("hover", full_width = FALSE)
```

Statistics can also be used to help us **interpret** our world. Daily weather forecasts, for example, typically include statistical predictions. See, for example, the brown line on the bottom graph labeled "Precipitation Potential (%)."

# The "Central Dogma" of Statistics {.tabset .tabset-fade}

The figure below illustrates the "central dogma" of statistics. Using statistics, we seek to learn more about the **population** of interest. However, we rarely (if ever!) have access to every unit in a population. Therefore, we take a representative sample, or a representative subset of the population, and use this sample to **describe** (descriptive statistics) and make **inferences/predictions/generalizations** (inferential statistics) about the population.

> But what exactly is a **statistic**?

Examine the figure again. Notice that the figure showing the central dogma consists of a population and a sample. **Statistics are numbers that describe characteristics of samples** while **parameters describe populations**.

> We use statistics from a sample to estimate (infer) parameters in a population.

Recall (from Week 9) that a **sample** consists of the units (in the case of survey research, people) that are included in a study. The **population**, on the other hand, is the entire group in which a researcher is interested. The population is a theoretically specified aggregation of the units (i.e., people) in the study.

Because the population is theoretical (i.e., it is almost impossible to get data from everyone in the population), we instead collect data from a sample and use those data to estimate the same characteristics in the population. If you were interested in knowing the average height of adults in the U.S., you would collect a sample that is representative of all American adults, measure their individual heights, and calculate a mean from this sample. The calculated mean provides an estimate of the same parameter in the population.

The tabs below contain summaries of the terms *statistic* and *parameter*.

## Parameter

- number that describes the **population** (e.g., mean, standard deviation, variance, etc.)
- parameters are often unknown because we cannot directly examine the entire population of interest!

---

## Statistic

- number that can be computed from **sample** data (e.g., mean, standard deviation, variance, etc.)
- we use statistics in a sample to estimate parameters in a population!
- for example, we can calculate the mean age in a sample and use this statistic to estimate the mean age in the population.

# Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics

In general, there are two types of statistics: **descriptive** and **inferential statistics**. The figure below highlights the differences between these two types and provides examples of questions that researchers might ask using descriptive and inferential statistics.
