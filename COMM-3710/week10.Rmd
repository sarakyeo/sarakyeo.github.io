# General Steps to Analyze Data
1. Manage data
   - Frequency distributions
   - Recoding data
   - Creating composite or secondary variables
2. Hypothesis testing (review Week 9: Inferential Statistics, if necessary)
   - $\chi^2$ test of independent
   - $t$-test
   - Pearson's correlation

At this point in the course, you will have conducted most of these steps in data analysis through your individual lab assignments and even in your group project assignments. Review the videos and resources embedded in your lab assignments and group projects.

Other resources for using R and RStudio for data analysis can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/yesun/Comm3710_helpwithR).

# Step 1: Managing Data
To manage your data, you should be able to run frequency distributions, recode any variables, and create composite variables.

Watch the videos below to refresh your memory on conducting the functions in R:
