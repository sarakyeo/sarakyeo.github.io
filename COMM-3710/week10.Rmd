# General Steps to Analyze Data
1. Cleaning raw data
2. Data reduction and scaling
3. Creating new composite variables
4. Hypothesis testing (review Week 9: Inferential Statistics, if necessary)
   - $\chi^2$ test of independent
   - $t$-test
   - Pearson's correlation

At this point in the course, you will have conducted most of these steps in data analysis through your individual lab assignments and even in your group project assignments. Review the videos and resources embedded in your lab assignments and group projects.

Other resources for using R and RStudio for data analysis can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/yesun/Comm3710_helpwithR).
