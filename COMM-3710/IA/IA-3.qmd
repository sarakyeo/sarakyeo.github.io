#### Objective:
To understand the process of designing, conducting, and analyzing a survey in social science research.

#### Instructions:

1. **Formulate a Research Question:**
   - Choose a topic of interest within social sciences (e.g., social media usage, study habits, public opinion on a social issue).
   - Develop a clear and concise research question. For example, "How does social media usage affect academic performance among college students?"

2. **Design the Survey:**
   - Create a survey with 10-15 questions that address your research question.
   - Include a mix of question types (e.g., multiple-choice, Likert scale, open-ended).
   - Ensure questions are clear, unbiased, and relevant to the research question.

3. **Sampling:**
   - Decide on your target population (e.g., undergraduate students at your university).
   - Determine a sampling method (e.g., random sampling, convenience sampling).
   - Aim for a sample size of at least 30 respondents to ensure sufficient data for analysis.

4. **Conduct the Survey:**
   - Distribute the survey to your chosen sample using an online survey tool (e.g., Google Forms, SurveyMonkey).
   - Collect responses over a specified period (e.g., one week).

5. **Analyze the Data:**
   - Compile the survey responses and analyze the data using basic statistical methods.
   - Summarize the findings in tables or charts.
   - Identify any patterns or trends in the data.

6. **Report the Findings:**
   - Write a brief report (2-3 pages) summarizing your research question, survey design, data collection process, analysis, and key findings.
   - Discuss any limitations of your survey and suggest areas for future research.

#### Deliverables:
- A copy of your survey questionnaire.
- A summary of your sampling method and data collection process.
- Data analysis results (tables/charts).
- A written report of your findings.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- Clarity and relevance of the research question.
- Quality and variety of survey questions.
- Appropriateness of the sampling method.
- Accuracy and thoroughness of data analysis.
- Clarity and coherence of the written report.
