# Formulate a Research Question

1) Choose a topic of interest within social sciences (e.g., social media usage, study habits, public opinion on a social issue). Develop a clear and concise research question (e.g., "How does social media usage during class affect academic performance among college students?") or hypothesis (e.g., "Social media use in class is negatively associated with academic performance among college students.") for your topic.

2) Identify the independent and dependent variables in your research question or hypothesis.

3) Next, we will explicate the independent and dependent variables/concepts in your research question or hypothesis. Conduct the process of concept explication for both your concepts

4) For each concept, design **at least 3** survey questions that measure it (i.e., you should have at least 6 survey questions. 

2. **Design the Survey:**
   - Create a survey with 10-15 questions that address your research question.
   - Include a mix of question types (e.g., multiple-choice, Likert scale, open-ended).
   - Ensure questions are clear, unbiased, and relevant to the research question.

3. **Sampling:**
   - Decide on your target population (e.g., undergraduate students at your university).
   - Determine a sampling method (e.g., random sampling, convenience sampling).
   - Aim for a sample size of at least 30 respondents to ensure sufficient data for analysis.

4. **Conduct the Survey:**
   - Distribute the survey to your chosen sample using an online survey tool (e.g., Google Forms, SurveyMonkey).
   - Collect responses over a specified period (e.g., one week).

5. **Analyze the Data:**
   - Compile the survey responses and analyze the data using basic statistical methods.
   - Summarize the findings in tables or charts.
   - Identify any patterns or trends in the data.

6. **Report the Findings:**
   - Write a brief report (2-3 pages) summarizing your research question, survey design, data collection process, analysis, and key findings.
   - Discuss any limitations of your survey and suggest areas for future research.

#### Deliverables:
- A copy of your survey questionnaire.
- A summary of your sampling method and data collection process.
- Data analysis results (tables/charts).
- A written report of your findings.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- Clarity and relevance of the research question.
- Quality and variety of survey questions.
- Appropriateness of the sampling method.
- Accuracy and thoroughness of data analysis.
- Clarity and coherence of the written report.
