<!-- 2 points for each question. -->

Using available library resources and databases, find a PDF of the following journal article:

:::callout-note
Liang, X., Su, L. Y.-F., Yeo, S. K., Scheufele, D. A., Brossard, D., Xenos, M. A., Nealey, P., & Corley, E. A. (2014). Building buzz: (Scientists) communicating science in new media environments. *Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 91*(4), 772â€“791. https://doi.org/10.1177/1077699014550092

This article exemplifies the process of concept explication. Carefully read pp. 772-779 of the article. Use the journal article to answer the following questions.

1) How many research questions and/or hypotheses are there in this study? Identify the concepts/constructs pertinent to all the research questions and hypotheses in the study.

<!-- There are three (3) hypotheses and two (2) research questions in this study. -->

2) Identify the dependent variable and the independent variables relevant to each research question and hypothesis in this article.

<!-- 
H1: IV = scientists' interactions with non-scientists; DV = scientific impact.

H2: IV = scientists' blogging about science; DV = scientific impact.

H3: IV = being mentioned on Twitter; DV = scientific impact.

RQ1: scientists' interaction with reporters; DV = scientific impact.

RQ2: IV = forms of communication behaviors; DV = scientific impact.
-->

3) Consider the dependent or outcome variable in this study. Answer the following questions.

   a) How did researchers conceptualize the dependent/outcome variable?
   <!-- Scientific impact vs. scientific reputation (first paragraph on p. 774). Used impact as the DV instead of reputation. -->
   b) Describe how the dependent variable is operationalized in the study.
   <!-- By using a scientists' *h*-index. -->

4) Select one independent variable from those you have identified.

   a) How did the researchers conceptualized this predictor variable?
   b) Describe how this predictor variable is operationalized in the study.

5) Using the same independent variable from the last question, provide an example of how the meaning of the study would be changed if this construct were conceptualized and operationalized differently.

Respond to each question using complete sentences. Clearly label your responses with the corresponding question number and check spelling and grammar in your submission.
