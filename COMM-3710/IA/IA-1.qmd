Using available library resources and databases, find the following journal article:

> Liang, X., Su, L. Y.-F., Yeo, S. K., Scheufele, D. A., Brossard, D., Xenos, M. A., Nealey, P., & Corley, E. A. (2014). Building buzz: (Scientists) communicating science in new media environments. *Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 91*(4), 772â€“791. https://doi.org/10.1177/1077699014550092

This article exemplifies the process of concept explication. Use the journal article to answer the following questions:

1) How many research questions hypotheses are there in this study? Identify the concepts/constructs pertinent to all the research questions and hypotheses in the study.

2) Identify the dependent variable and the independent variables relevant to each research question and hypothesis in this article.

3) Consider the dependent or outcome variable in this study. Answer the following questions.

   a) How did researcher conceptualize the dependent/outcome variable?
   b) Describe how the dependent variable is measured in the study.

4) Select one independent variable from those you have identified.

   a) Explain how this predictor variable is conceptualized by the researchers.
   b) Describe how this predictor variable is operationalized by the researchers.

5) Pick a construct. Give an example of how the meaning of the study would be changed if this construct were conceptualized and operationalized differently.

Respond to each question using **short essays with complete sentences**. Clearly label your responses with the corresponding question number and check spelling and grammar in your submission.
