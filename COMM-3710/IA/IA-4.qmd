### Assignment: Designing a Communication Experiment

**Objective:**  
To provide practical experience in designing an experiment within the field of communication studies.

**Instructions:**  
You have 45 minutes to complete this assignment. Follow the steps below and answer all questions.

---

#### Part 1: Conceptualizing Your Experiment (15 minutes)

1. **Research Question:**  
   Formulate a clear and concise research question related to communication. For example, "How does the use of emojis in text messages affect the perceived tone of the message?"

2. **Hypothesis:**  
   Develop a testable hypothesis based on your research question. For example, "Messages with emojis are perceived as more positive than messages without emojis."

---

#### Part 2: Designing the Experiment (30 minutes)

3. **Variables:**  
   - **Independent Variable:** Identify the variable you will manipulate (e.g., presence or absence of emojis).
   - **Dependent Variable:** Identify the variable you will measure (e.g., perceived tone of the message).

4. **Participants:**  
   Describe how you would select participants for your study. Include details about the sample size and any inclusion/exclusion criteria.

5. **Experimental Groups:**  
   Explain how you will divide participants into groups (e.g., control group receiving messages without emojis and experimental group receiving messages with emojis).

6. **Procedure:**  
   Outline the steps you would take to conduct the experiment. Include details about how you will present the messages to participants and how you will measure their responses.

7. **Control Measures:**  
   Describe how you will control for potential confounding variables to ensure the validity of your results (e.g., ensuring all messages are of similar length and content).

8. **Data Collection and Analysis:**  
   Explain how you will collect and analyze the data. What statistical tests will you use to determine if your hypothesis is supported?

9. **Ethical Considerations:**  
   Discuss any ethical considerations you need to take into account when conducting this experiment. How will you ensure the participants' privacy and consent?
