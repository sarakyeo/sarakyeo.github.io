# Formulate a Research Question

Choose a topic of interest within social sciences (e.g., social media usage, study habits, public opinion on a social issue). Develop a clear and concise research question (e.g., "How does social media usage during class affect academic performance among college students?") or hypothesis (e.g., "Social media use in class is negatively associated with academic performance among college students.") for your topic.

# Explicate the Concepts 

1) Identify the concepts that represent the independent and dependent variables in your research question or hypothesis.

2) Next, we will explicate these concepts. Explicate the concepts that represent both independent and dependent variables, and answer the following questions:
   a) What is the working definition of the concept that represents the **dependent variable**?
   b) What is the working definition of the concept that represents the **independent variable**?
 
# Design your Survey Questions

1) For each concept, design **at least 3** survey questions that measure it (i.e., you should have at least 6 survey questions for this assignment). Try to use different types of scales (e.g., Likert, semantic differential) and multiple items in a matrix format to measure your concepts. Use the template on Canvas for your survey codebook.

2) Set up your Qualtrics account. Follow the instructions at [software.utah.edu](https://software.utah.edu/faq/license/qualtrics/index.php). Be sure to check your Spam folder in your email for a confirmation email. It can take several minutes to arrive in your Inbox.
   
#  Program your Survey Questions
   
Create a new survey project from scratch on Qualtrics (blue button on bottom left of screen). Program the questions into Qualtrics. If you need help with Qualtrics programming, see [https://www.qualtrics.com/support](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/).

If you are working in a group, your group should work together to program the survey on one's group member's Qualtrics account. You can share the survey with others in the group via Qualtrics.

# Get Some Responses

Once you are done programming your survey, [share it on Canvas](https://utah.instructure.com/courses/1174106/discussion_topics/7899996?module_item_id=30528745) so other students can complete your survey!

Once you have posted your survey on Canvas, complete as many of your classmates' surveys as you can!
