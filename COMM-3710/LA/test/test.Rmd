# Data
For this assignment, you will be working with the [Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary Care (HELP) data set](https://utah.instructure.com/files/108105219/download?download_frd=1). Submit your answers as a PDF document on Canvas.

The HELP study was a clinical trial for adult inpatients recruited from a detoxification unit. Patients with no primary care physician were randomized to receive a multidisciplinary assessment and a brief motivational intervention or usual care, with the goal of linking them to primary medical care.

The data set contains 453 observations on the following variables:

* `age`: Subject age at baseline (in years)
* `anysub`: Use of any substance post-detox (a factor with levels no yes)
* `cesd`: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression measure at baseline (high scores indicate more depressive symptoms)
* `d1`: lifetime number of hospitalizations for medical problems (measured at baseline)
* `daysanysub`: time (in days) to first use of any substance post-detox
* `dayslink`: time (in days) to linkage to primary care
* `drugrisk`: Risk Assessment Battery drug risk scale at baseline
* `e2b`: number of times in past 6 months entered a detox program (measured at baseline)
* `female`: 0 for male, 1 for female
* `sex`: a factor with levels male female
* `g1b`: experienced serious thoughts of suicide in last 30 days (measured at baseline; a factor with levels no yes)
* `homeless`: housing status: a factor with levels housed homeless
* `i1`: average number of drinks (standard units) consumed per day, in the past 30 days (measured at baseline)
* `i2`: maximum number of drinks (standard units) consumed per day, in the past 30 days (measured at baseline)
* `id`: subject identifier
* `indtot`: Inventory of Drug Use Consequences (InDUC) total score (measured at baseline)
* `linkstatus`: post-detox linkage to primary care (0 = no, 1 = yes)
* `link`: post-detox linkage to primary care: no yes
* `mcs`: SF-36 Mental Component Score (measured at baseline, lower scores indicate worse status)
* `pcs`: SF-36 Physical Component Score (measured at baseline, lower scores indicate worse status)
* `pss_fr`: perceived social support by friends (measured at baseline, higher scores indicate more support)
* `racegrp`: race/ethnicity: levels black hispanic other white
* `satreat`: any BSAS substance abuse treatment at baseline (no yes)
* `sexrisk`: Risk Assessment Battery sex risk score (measured at baseline)
* `substance`: primary substance of abuse (alcohol cocaine heroin)
* `treat`: randomized to HELP clinic (no yes)

# Instructions

## Step 1 {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### Question
Load/Read the [HELP]() data set into R. This data set is saved as a .csv file.

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Hint



### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## Topic 2

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
