```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(descr)
hdata <- read.csv("HELP.csv")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

In this assignment, you will put the skills you learned in LA-5 into practice.

Remember to ...

1) Set up your R script appropriately.
2) Include a comment for each line of code in your R script. This can be pseudocode or other comments.

# Step 1
Read [Chapter 5 of COMM 3710: Getting Started with R](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710-bookdown/docs/ggplot2.html).


# Step 2
Load the following packages in your current session of R:

- `tidyverse`
- `summarytools`

Read the [Utilities.csv](https://utah.instructure.com/files/117853079/download?download_frd=1) data set into R. Use the [codebook](https://github.com/sarakyeo/sarakyeo.github.io/blob/master/COMM-3710/LA/README.MD#utilities-dataset) to familiarize yourself with the variables in the data set.


# Step 3 {.tabset .tabset-fade}
## Question
Make a histogram to display the distribution of customers' total monthly bill
(include the graph in your PDF submission) and answer the following question.

a. Use the histogram you created and describe the distribution. Is the
distribution skewed or symmetric? If skewed, is the distribution skewed right
or left? At what cost do most of the total monthly bills fall?

## Hint
Read [Chapter 5 of COMM 3710: Getting Started with R](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710-bookdown/docs/ggplot2.html). We will use the package,
`ggplot2` to create visuals in R. `ggplot2` is included in the `tidyverse` package.

To create a histogram, the `ggplot2` commands you will use are: `ggplot()` and `geom_histogram()`. Remember that you can also read the documentation for these commands by typing `?ggplot` and `?geom_histogram` in the Console.
      
Once you have created the graph, it will appear in the **Plots** panel (usually bottom right of RStudio).

If you need help answering Q2a, see "Wrench Ch. 14: Skewness and Kurtosis" for an explanation of skewness.


# Step 4 {.tabset .tabset-fade}
## Question
Make a scatter plot to display gas bill by month (include the graph in your PDF
submission).

a. Based on your graph, which month do you think has the highest **average**
gas bill?
b. Use R to calculate the average gas bill for the months of January and
December. Which is higher?

## Hint
Watch Video 07 to learn how to make a scatter plot. The commands you will use
are `ggplot()` and `geom_point()`.

To calculate the average gas bill for January, first filter the data to contain
only observations from January (i.e., `month == 1`). To do this, create an
object that filters the `utilities` data frame by month.
 
For example, if I wanted to filter the data to contain only observations from
September, I would use the code:`sep <- filter(utilities, month == 9)`. For
help with the `filter` function, type `?filter` into your Console window.
      
Then, use the `mean()` function to calculate the average gas bill for that
month. Type `?mean` into the Console and read the documentation for this
function. Remember to strip NA values from your computation by using the
argument, `na.rm = TRUE`.


# Step 5
Make a scatter plot to display electric bill by month (include the graph in
your PDF submission).

a. Based on your graph, which month do you think has the highest **average**
electric bill?
b. Calculate the average electric bill for the months of September and
December. Which is higher?


# Step 6
Make a scatter plot to display the relationship between gas usage and gas bill
(include the graph in your PDF submission). 

a. Does there appear to be a relationship between gas usage and gas bill?


# Step 7
Make a scatter plot to display the relationship between electricity usage and
electric bill (include the graph in your PDF submission).

a. Does there appear to be a relationship between electricity usage and
electric bill? 


# Step 8 {.tabset .tabset-fade}
## Question
Create a new categorical variable called `season`. Have the variable equal
winter if the bill was from December, January, or February. Have the variable
equal spring if the bill was from March, April, or May. Have the variable equal
summer if the bill was from June, July, or August. Have the variable equal fall
if the bill was from September, October, or November.

a. Include the frequency table for `season` in your PDF submission.
    
## Hint
Use the skills you learned in data management (e.g., subsetting) to create a
new variable called `season` according to the instructions. Then, use the
`freq()` command from the `descr` package to check that you have created the
`season` variable correctly.

# Bonus Question
Make a bar chart to display the count or proportion of donors by season
(include the graph in your PDF submission). 

First, make a new variable, `DonorStatus`. Set DonorStatus equal to 1 if the
billee donated money to *Operation Fuel* and 0 otherwise. Check that you have
created the `DonorStatus` variable correctly. Include frequency tables for both
`donate` and `DonorStatus` in your PDF submission.

Then, use `ggplot()` to create your graph.

Does there seem to be a relationship between season and donation?


# Submission
Submit your R script (`LA-7_FirstName-LastName.R`) to Canvas.

Your R script should:

1) Include code to install and load the packages.
2) Include code to set your working directory.
3) Contain comments and/or pseudocode for every single line of R code.
4) Run in its entirety without errors.

To ensure that your R script runs without errors, you should:

- Save your script.
- Completely shut down RStudio or restart your R session.
- Reopen RStudio, open your `LA-7_FirstName-LastName.R` script.
- Run the entire script by clicking the "Run" button in the top right of the R script.

> These standards apply to all submissions in this course that require R scripts.
