```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(descr)
hdata <- read.csv("HELP.csv")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

In this assignment, you will put the skills you learned in LA-5 into practice.

Remember to ...

1) Set up your R script appropriately.
2) Include a comment for each line of code in your R script. This can be pseudocode or other comments.

# Step 1 {.tabset .tabset-fade}
Import the [Utilities.csv](https://utah.instructure.com/files/117853079/download?download_frd=1) data set into R. Use the [codebook](https://github.com/sarakyeo/sarakyeo.github.io/blob/master/COMM-3710/LA/README.MD#utilities-dataset) to familiarize yourself with the variables.


# Step 2 {.tabset .tabset-fade}
Make a histogram to display the distribution of customers' total monthly bill
(include the graph in your PDF submission) and answer the following question.

a. Use the histogram you created and describe the distribution. Is the
distribution skewed or symmetric? If skewed, is the distribution skewed right
or left? At what cost do most of the total monthly bills fall?

### Hint (HERE)
To create a histogram, first watch Video 06. We will use the package,
`ggplot2`. The `ggplot2` commands you will use are: `ggplot()` and
`geom_histogram()`. Remember that you can also read the documentation for these
commands by typing `?ggplot` and `?geom_histogram` in the Console.
      
In the bottom right **Plot** screen in RStudio, you can **Export** the graph as
an image or **Copy** and paste it in your Word document before saving the Word
document as a PDF.

If you need help answering Q2a, see "Wrench Ch. 14: Skewness and Kurtosis" for
an explanation of skewness or watch [Video 06](https://youtu.be/mwLyXHfCPdE)
starting at 14:02.

## Step 3 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
### Question
Make a scatter plot to display gas bill by month (include the graph in your PDF
submission).

a. Based on your graph, which month do you think has the highest **average**
gas bill?
b. Use R to calculate the average gas bill for the months of January and
December. Which is higher?

### Hint
Watch Video 07 to learn how to make a scatter plot. The commands you will use
are `ggplot()` and `geom_point()`.

To calculate the average gas bill for January, first filter the data to contain
only observations from January (i.e., `month == 1`). To do this, create an
object that filters the `utilities` data frame by month.
 
For example, if I wanted to filter the data to contain only observations from
September, I would use the code:`sep <- filter(utilities, month == 9)`. For
help with the `filter` function, type `?filter` into your Console window.
      
Then, use the `mean()` function to calculate the average gas bill for that
month. Type `?mean` into the Console and read the documentation for this
function. Remember to strip NA values from your computation by using the
argument, `na.rm = TRUE`.

## Step 4
Make a scatter plot to display electric bill by month (include the graph in
your PDF submission).

a. Based on your graph, which month do you think has the highest **average**
electric bill?
b. Calculate the average electric bill for the months of September and
December. Which is higher?

## Step 5
Make a scatter plot to display the relationship between gas usage and gas bill
(include the graph in your PDF submission). 

a. Does there appear to be a relationship between gas usage and gas bill?

## Step 6
Make a scatter plot to display the relationship between electricity usage and
electric bill (include the graph in your PDF submission).

a. Does there appear to be a relationship between electricity usage and
electric bill? 

## Step 7 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
### Question
Create a new categorical variable called `season`. Have the variable equal
winter if the bill was from December, January, or February. Have the variable
equal spring if the bill was from March, April, or May. Have the variable equal
summer if the bill was from June, July, or August. Have the variable equal fall
if the bill was from September, October, or November.

a. Include the frequency table for `season` in your PDF submission.
    
### Hint
Use the skills you learned in data management (e.g., subsetting) to create a
new variable called `season` according to the instructions. Then, use the
`freq()` command from the `descr` package to check that you have created the
`season` variable correctly.

## Bonus Question
Make a bar chart to display the count or proportion of donors by season
(include the graph in your PDF submission). 

First, make a new variable, `DonorStatus`. Set DonorStatus equal to 1 if the
billee donated money to *Operation Fuel* and 0 otherwise. Check that you have
created the `DonorStatus` variable correctly. Include frequency tables for both
`donate` and `DonorStatus` in your PDF submission.

Then, use `ggplot()` to create your graph.

Does there seem to be a relationship between season and donation?

## Submission
Submit the following on Canvas:

a. A **.R file** containing the code used to complete this assignment. This
document should include comments that explain your commands.
b. A **PDF file** containing the answers/figures/tables to each
question--clearly label the answers with the question number.
