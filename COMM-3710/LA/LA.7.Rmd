# Resources
Before starting this assignment, review the following videos, if necessary:

1. [Hypothesis testing](https://youtu.be/08uylSp-CuI)
2. [Analysis of variance (ANOVA)](https://youtu.be/2uQCUBtqCfM)
3. [Chi-square test of independence](https://youtu.be/Dnlp9vswwEk)

Remember that help with R is also available in the [COMM 3710: Getting Started with R](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710-bookdown/docs/ggplot2.html) book and
other resources available in the R Resources module on Canvas.

# Data
[Data for this assignment comes from the 1985 Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://utah.instructure.com/files/108105224/download?download_frd=1).
The CPS is used to supplement census information between census years. These
data consist of a random sample of persons from the survey, with information
on wages and other characteristics of the workers, including sex, number of
years of education, years of work experience, occupational status, region of
residence and union membership.

A data frame with 534 observations on the following variables:

* `wage`: wage (US dollars per hour)
*	`educ`: number of years of education
*	`race`: a factor with levels NW (nonwhite) or W (white)
*	`sex`: a factor with levels FM
*	`hispanic`: a factor with levels Hisp or NH
*	`south`: a factor with levels NSS
*	`married`: a factor with levels Married or Single
*	`exper`: number of years of work experience (inferred from age and educ)
*	`union`: a factor with levels Not or Union
*	`age`: age in years
*	`sector`: a factor with levels clerical const manag manuf other prof sales
service
*	`satisfaction`: 1 implies participant satisfied with current employment, 0
otherwise

# Instructions

## Step 1
Familiarize yourself with the CPS documentation above. Then, load the [CPS data set](https://utah.instructure.com/files/108105224/download?download_frd=1) in R.

## Step 2
Find the mean wage earned per hour for males and females.

a. What is the mean wage earned per hour for females?
b. What is the mean wage earned per hour for males?
 
## Step 3
Implement the appropriate statistical test to determine whether males have
significantly higher wages earned per hour than females. Use the chart from
[LA.6](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710/LA/LA.6.html) to guide your choice
of statistical test.

a. What statistical test did you use? <!--Independent samples t-test-->
b. What is the value of the test statistic? <!--t = -4.84, p < .001-->
c. What conclusions can be drawn? <!--There is a statistically significant
difference in mean wage per hour between men and women-->

## Step 4
Implement the appropriate statistical test to determine whether there is a
significant linear relationship between wages earned per hour and number of
years of work experience.

a. What statistical test did you use? <!--Pearson's correlation-->
b. What is the value of the test statistic? <!--Pearson's r = .09, p = .044-->
c. What conclusions can be drawn? <!-- There is a statistically significant
relationship between the variables that is weak and positive-->

## Step 5
Implement the appropriate statistical test to determine whether job
satisfaction varies significantly among the different job sectors.

a. What statistical test did you use? <!--Chi-squared test-->
b. What is the value of the test statistic? <!--X-squared = 3.65, df = 7,
p = .82-->
c. What conclusions can be drawn? <!--Job satisfaction and job sector are not
related-->

## Step 6
Submit the following on Canvas.

a. A **.R file** containing the annotated code used to complete this
assignment. This document should include comments that explain your commands.
b. A **PDF file** containing the answers to each question--clearly label the
answers with the corresponding question number.
