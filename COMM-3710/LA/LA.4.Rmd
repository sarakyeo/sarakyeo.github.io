# Resources
- Before starting this assignment, watch the following video: https://youtu.be/b9Bh3K5bi0I. Once again, keep this link handy as you may need to watch the video several times to complete the assignment.
- Additional resources for R can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/yesun/652965).

# Instructions
1. Load in the [HELP data set](https://utah.instructure.com/files/102658359/download?download_frd=1) from [LA.3](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710/LA/LA.3.html). If necessary, review the codebook (explanation of variables) in [LA.3](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710/LA/LA.3.html).

<summary>Hint</summary>

   The command to read a .csv data file to an object named `helpdata` in R is:
   ```
   helpdata <- read.csv("HELP.csv")
   ```

2. Patients with a mental component score (`mcs`) less than 20 are thought to be at extreme risk of returning to the detoxification unit within the next 12 months. Make a new variable called `ExtremeMCS` and code it as 1 if a patient is at risk based on his/her `mcs` score and 0 otherwise. 
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

   One way to create a new variable in the `helpdata` data frame is to use the following command:
   ```
   helpdata$ExtremeMCS <- ifelse(helpdata$mcs < 20, 1, 0)
   ```
</details> 
<br>

3. Make a new variable `SuicidalThought` based on the variable `g1b`. Have 1 indicate a patient has had suicidal thoughts and a 0 indicate they have not. 
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

   You can use the same logic from the command in Q2 to create this variable. If you need help with the `ifelse` command, type `?ifelse` in the Console window of RStudio.
</details>
<br>

4. Make a new variable `HomelessStatus` based on the variable `homeless`. Have 1 indicate that a patient is homeless and 0 indicate that they are housed.
<br>

5. Suppose we want to assess the overall risk a patient has to return to the detoxification unit and `ExtremeMCS`, `SuicidalThought`, and `HomelessStatus` are considered risk factors. Construct a new variable called `RiskTotal` which computes the number of risk factors a particular patient has. That is, make it a sum of these 3 variables.
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

   You want to create a new variable called `RiskTotal`, which is the sum of `ExtremeMCS`, `SuicidalThought`, and `HomelessStatus`. One way to do this is to transform the data (*Note*: Like most things in R, there are many other ways to do this):
   ```
   helpdata <- transform(helpdata, RiskTotal = ExtremeMCS + SuicidalThought + HomelessStatus)
   ```
</details>
<br>

6. Make frequency tables of `ExtremeMCS`, `SuicidalThought`, and `RiskTotal`.
      a. How many patients are thought to be at risk based on their `mcs` score? <!--91-->
      b. What percentage of patients have experienced suicidal thoughts? <!--28.0%-->
      c. What percentage of patients in the study have fewer than 3 risk factors? <!--94.9%-->

   <details>
   <summary>Hint</summary>

      Refer to LA.3 to review creating frequency tables.

7. Submit the following on Canvas:
   (a) A **.R file** containing the code used to complete this assignment. This document should include comments that explain your commands.
   (b) A **PDF file** containing the answers to each question--clearly label the answers with the question number.
