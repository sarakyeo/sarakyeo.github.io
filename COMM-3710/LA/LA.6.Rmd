# Instructions
## Question 1
Load the [Utilities.csv](https://utah.instructure.com/files/108105204/download?download_frd=1) data set from [LA.5](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710/LA/LA.5.html) and re-familiarize yourself with the variables. Apply your data management code from the previous assignment that created the `season` variable. Ensure that the data management code and the frequency table for `season` are included in your R script and PDF submission, respectively.

## Question 2 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
### Question
Use an appropriate statistical test to determine whether there is a relationship between total bill and season. Then, answer the questions below.

   a. What statistical test did you use?
   b. What is the test statistic and the probability value associated with that test statistic?
   c. Is there a significant relationship between total bill and season?

### Hints
#### Selecting a statistical test
First, identify whether the independent and dependent variables are quantitative/continuous or categorical (see LA.2 if you need a reminder). Then, use the chart below to select a statistical test.

#### Test statistics and *p*-values
| Hypothesis Test       | Test Statistic Name               | Test Statistic Symbol |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Chi-squared test      | Chi-squared value                 | $\chi^2$              |
| t-test                | *t*-value                         | $t$                   |
| ANOVA                 | *F*-value                         | $F$                   |
| Pearson's correlation | Pearson's correlation coefficient | $r$                   |

The images below identify the test statistics and *p*-values in R output. Be sure to report the correct values. If $p < 0.05$, then the relationship is significant.
