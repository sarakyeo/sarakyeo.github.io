# Data
Use the [Utilities.csv](https://utah.instructure.com/files/108105204/download?download_frd=1) data set to complete this assignment. This data set contains a random sample of 117 utility bills for the following variables:

* `month`: month (coded as a number)
*	`day`: day of month on which bill was calculated
*	`year`: year of bill
*	`temp`: average temperature ($^{\circ}$F) for billing period
*	`kwh`: electricity usage (kwh)
*	`ccf`: gas usage (ccf)
*	`thermsPerDay`: a numeric vector
*	`billingDays`: number of billing days in billing period
*	`totalbill`: total bill (in dollars)
*	`gasbill`: gas bill (in dollars)
*	`elecbill`: electric bill (in dollars)
*	`notes`: notes about the billing period
*	`donate`: (yes or no) did the person add money to their bill to be donated to Operation Fuel, a charity providing heat to families/small businesses in need

# Instructions
## Step 1
Load the [Utilities.csv](https://utah.instructure.com/files/108105204/download?download_frd=1) data set and re-familiarize yourself with the variables. Apply your data management code from [LA.5](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710/LA/LA.5.html) to create the `season` variable.

   a. Include the data management code that you used to create `season` in your R file.
   b. Include the frequency table for `season` in your PDF submission.

## Step 2 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
### Question
Use an appropriate statistical test to determine whether there is a relationship between total bill and season. Then, answer the questions below.

   a. What statistical test did you use?
   b. What is the test statistic and the probability value associated with that test statistic?
   c. Is there a significant relationship between total bill and season?

### Hints
#### Selecting a statistical test
First, identify whether the independent and dependent variables are quantitative/continuous or categorical (see LA.2 if you need a reminder). Then, use the chart below to select a statistical test.

*Note*: You will have to replace `dataframe`, `ind_var`, and `dep_var` in the R commands listed in the chart with your own data frame, independent variable, and dependent variable names.

#### Test statistics and *p*-values
| Hypothesis Test       | Test Statistic Name               | Test Statistic Symbol |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Chi-squared test      | Chi-squared value                 | $\chi^2$              |
| t-test                | *t*-value                         | $t$                   |
| ANOVA                 | *F*-value                         | $F$                   |
| Pearson's correlation | Pearson's correlation coefficient | $r$                   |

The images below identify the test statistics and *p*-values in R output. Be sure to report the correct values. If $p < 0.05$, then the relationship is significant.

## Step 3
Submit the following on Canvas:

   (a) A **.R file** containing the code used to complete this assignment. This document should include comments that explain your commands.
   (b) A **PDF file** containing the answers to each question--clearly label the answers with the question number.
