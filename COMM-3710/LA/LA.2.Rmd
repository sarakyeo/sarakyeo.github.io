Although you will be working with previously collected data, it is important to understand what data looks like as well as how it is coded and entered into a spreadsheet or data set for analysis.

Use the [medical records](https://utah.instructure.com/files/102622371/download?download_frd=1) for 5 patients seeking treatment in a hospital emergency room to accomplish the following:

* Select 4 variables recorded on the medical forms (one should be a unique identifier, at least one should be a quantitative variable and at least one should be a categorical variable)
*	Select a brief name (ideally 8 characters or less) for each variable
*	Determine what range of values is needed for recording each variable (create dummy codes as needed)
*	Label variables within an Excel spreadsheet
*	Enter data for each patient in the Excel spreadsheet
*	List the variable names, labels, types, and, response codes below the data set (i.e. the code book).
*	Submit the excel file (.XLS, .XLSX) on Canvas.

A sample submission is shown below.
