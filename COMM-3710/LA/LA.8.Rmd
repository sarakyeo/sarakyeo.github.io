# Data
You will use the [Ithaca.csv](https://utah.instructure.com/files/108105203/download?download_frd=1) data set for this assignment. These data were collected by students in a research methods course at Cornell University for teaching purposes.

A data frame with 465 observations on the following variables^[`99` = “Don’t know” unless otherwise specified]:

*	`tvinat`: Attention to international news (0 = “Little attention,” 10 = “Very close attention”)
*	`tvnaat`: Attention to national news (0 = “Little attention,” 10 = “Very close attention”)
*	`tvhardat`: Attention to news about politics and economy (0 = “Little attention,” 10 = “Very close attention”)
*	`tvsoftat`: Attention to soft news (0 = “Little attention,” 10 = “Very close attention”)
*	`tvcrat`: Attention to crime dramas (0 = “Little attention,” 10 = “Very close attention”)
*	`tvcomat`: Attention to ctvomedies (0 = “Little attention,” 10 = “Very close attention”)
*	`educ`: Highest year of school completed
*	`age`: Age of respondent
*	`marit`: Marital status (1 = “single,” 2 = “married,” 3 = “divorced/separated,” 4 = “widowed,” 5 = “other,” 9 = “Don’t know/NA”)
*	`sex`: 1 =  0 = “female,” 1 = “male”

# Instructions
1. Familiarize yourself with the [Ithaca.csv](https://utah.instructure.com/files/108105203/download?download_frd=1) codebook above. Then, import/load the data set.

<br>

2. Conduct data management as necessary on these variables: `tvnaat`, `tvhardat`, `tvsoftat`, `sex`, `marit`. For example, you might have to remove missing data or recode "Don't know" responses as `NA`.

<br>

3. Find the mean attention to national TV news for males and females.
      a. What is the mean attention to national TV news for women?
      b. What is the mean attention to national TV news for men?
      
<br>

4. Implement the appropriate statistical test to determine whether men spend significantly more time watching national TV news compared to women.
      a. What statistical test did you use?
      b. What is the value of the test statistic and the *p*-value?
      c. What conclusions can be drawn?

<br>

5. Implement the appropriate statistical test to determine whether there is a significant linear relationship between attention to national TV news and attention to news about politics and economy.
      a. What statistical test did you use?
      b. What is the value of the test statistic and the *p*-value?
      c. What conclusions can be drawn?

<br>

6. Implement the appropriate statistical test to determine whether attention to soft news varies significantly depending on marital status.
      a. What statistical test did you use?
      b. What is the value of the test statistic and the *p*-value?
      c. What conclusions can be drawn?
