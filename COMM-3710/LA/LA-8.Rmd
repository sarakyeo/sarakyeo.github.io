```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(descr)
hdata <- read.csv("HELP.csv")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

In this assignment, you will learn how to:

- Select a statistical test.

Remember to ...

1) Set up your R script appropriately.
2) Include a comment for each line of code in your R script. This can be pseudocode or other comments.

---

# Step 1
Load the following packages in R:

- `tidyverse`
- `summarytools`
- `rstatix`

Then, load the [Utilities.csv](https://utah.instructure.com/files/108105204/download?download_frd=1) data set and re-familiarize yourself with the variables. Apply your data management code from [LA.5](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710/LA/LA.5.html) to create the `season` variable.

a) Include the data management code that you used to create `season` in your R file.
b) Include the frequency table for `season` in your PDF submission.

# Step 2 {.tabset .tabset-fade}
### Question
Use an appropriate statistical test to determine whether there is a relationship between total bill and season. Then, answer the questions below.

   a. What statistical test did you use?
   b. What is the test statistic and the probability value associated with that test statistic?
   c. Is there a significant relationship between total bill and season?

### Hints
#### Selecting a statistical test
First, identify whether the independent and dependent variables are quantitative/continuous or categorical (see LA.2 if you need a reminder). Then, use the chart below to select a statistical test.

*Note*: You will have to replace `dataframe`, `ind_var`, and `dep_var` in the R commands listed in the chart with your own data frame, independent variable, and dependent variable names.

#### Test statistics and *p*-values
| Hypothesis Test       | Test Statistic Name               | Test Statistic Symbol |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Chi-squared test      | Chi-squared value                 | $\chi^2$              |
| t-test                | *t*-value                         | $t$                   |
| ANOVA                 | *F*-value                         | $F$                   |
| Pearson's correlation | Pearson's correlation coefficient | $r$                   |

The images below identify the test statistics and *p*-values in R output. Be sure to report the correct values. If $p < 0.05$, then the relationship is significant.

## Step 3
Submit the following on Canvas:

   (a) A **.R file** containing the code used to complete this assignment. This document should include comments that explain your commands.
   (b) A **PDF file** containing the answers to each question--clearly label the answers with the question number.
