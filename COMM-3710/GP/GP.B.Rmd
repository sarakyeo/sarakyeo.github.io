# Instructions
First, watch these videos in the order listed:

1. https://youtu.be/_8A0zx51BKs (05:49)
2. https://youtu.be/FduVJ4tDsVo (24.44)

For the Group Project, we will be using publicly-available data from one of the following sources:

- [COVID Impact Survey](https://www.covid-impact.org/)
- [Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)](https://hints.cancer.gov/default.aspx)
- [National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)](https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/)

The first step of your project is to pick a data set and find a topic that interests you. It is up to you to decide what topic will spark the most interesting questions for you. What makes a data set interesting to you may be the general topics that are covered or specific questions/topics that are covered within the data set.

You will have to narrow down particular parts of the data set you find interesting. Your goal is to brainstorm some possible research questions. One of the simplest research questions that can be asked is whether two concepts are associated. An example is included below, but you cannot use this examples for your project.

\underline{Example}:
In the General Social Survey (GSS), participants were asked about their happiness in marriage (“Very Happy,” “Somewhat Happy,” or “Not Too Happy”) and also about their self-assessment of their own health (“Excellent,” “Good,” “Fair,” or “Poor”). One research question might be: Is there a relationship between health and relationship happiness?

Remember that you can modify your question as we move forward but it will benefit you greatly to spend time now deciding a direction for your project.

## To complete this assignment:

* Explore the data sets (links to these can be found on Canvas). After an initial exploration, pick one of the    data sets.
* Describe why the data set you chose is interesting to your group.
* Discuss and write down potential research questions.
* Copy and paste relevant components of the codebook into your group's personal codebook document. This will help you keep organized in the coming weeks, it is likely you will need to update your group's personal codebook document as your project and research question evolve.
* Please note you can have as few of two codebook items in your personal codebook or multiple pages of your personal codebook.

Submit GP.B as a PDF document on Canvas. A sample submission is included on the next page.

# Sample Submission
After looking through the codebook for the NESARC study (this dataset is not available this semester), I have decided that I am particularly interested in studying family background and depression. Examining mental health and trying to understand contributing factors to depression is something that I explored during my summer internship. While the internship focused on activity level and depression, I was always interested how parental figure’s own depression (either biologically or through interactions) may contribute to their child’s own depression in adulthood.

My personal codebook includes all questions in the NESARC study that give me information about mother and father depression, and some signs of individuals’ own depression:
