# Instructions

OPTIONAL: Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/IZoCbCQRmUE) about graphing relationships in R.

1. Construct a graph that shows the association between your explanatory/independent and outcome/dependent variables (bivariate graph).
2. Write a few sentences describing what your graphs reveal.
    * How do you think the variables are related, if at all?
    * How does this correspond with your predictions?
    * Does the graph reveal anything unexpected or interesting about your relationship of interest?
3. Construct a 2nd graph that shows the association between another explanatory variable and your dependent variable. Again, write a few sentences describing what your graph reveals in terms of the relationships among the variables.
4. Submit your assignment as a PDF document on Canvas.
