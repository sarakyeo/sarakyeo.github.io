# Instructions

OPTIONAL: Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/IZoCbCQRmUE) about graphing relationships in R.

1. Construct a graph that shows the association between your explanatory/independent and outcome/dependent variables (bivariate graph).

2. Write a few sentences describing what your graphs reveal.
    <ul>
    <li> How do you think the variables are related, if at all?
    <li> How does this correspond with your predictions?
    <li> Does the graph reveal anything unexpected or interesting about your relationship of interest?
    </ul>
    
3. Construct a 2nd graph that shows the association between another explanatory variable and your dependent variable. Again, write a few sentences describing what your graph reveals in terms of the relationships among the variables.

4. Submit two files on Canvas:
   <ul>
   <li> A **.R file** with all commands and comments.
   <li> A **PDF file** of the graphs and descriptions. Graphs should contain axes labels, captions, and, if applicable, legends.
   </ul>
