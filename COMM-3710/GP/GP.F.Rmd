# Instructions
There are a variety of ways to visualize data--tables, histograms, bar graphs, etc. Now that your data have been managed, it is time to create both univariate and bivariate graphs. We will use the `ggplot2` package to create graphs.

- A **univariate** graph is a visualization of one variable. A histogram is a type of univariate graph.
- A **bivariate** graph is a visualization of the relationship between two variables. A scatter plot is a type of bivariate graph.

## Step 1
Load the following packages in R:

- `tidyverse` (remember that this includes the `ggplot2` package)
- `descr`

## Step 2
Copy Table 2 from [GP.E](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710/GP/GP.E.html) into your PDF submission.

Using `ggplot2`, create histograms of all your independent and dependent variables. Include the graphs in your PDF submission and all R commands and annotations in your script.

Each graph should contain:

- Clear and relevant x-axis labels
- Clear and relevant y-axis labels
- Clear and relevant titles
- If applicable, clear and relevant legends


## Step 3
Revisit your submission for [GP.E](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710/GP/GP.E.html) and list your hypotheses and/or research questions (RQs) in your PDF submission.

For each hypothesis and/or research question, construct a bivariate graph that shows the relationship between your independent (IV) and dependent variable (DV). Again, each graph should contain:

- Clear and relevant x-axis labels
- Clear and relevant y-axis labels
- Clear and relevant titles
- If applicable, clear and relevant legends


## Submission
Submit two files on Canvas:

- A **.R file** with all commands and comments. The commands in this R script must run in its entirety and in order (i.e., from top to bottom) and include commands to set the working directory, load packages, and read data into R.
- A **PDF file** of the graphs and other required elements.
