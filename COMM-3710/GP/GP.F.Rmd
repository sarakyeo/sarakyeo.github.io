# Resources
If you need a reminder about graphing one variable at a time in R, watch this [video](https://youtu.be/mwLyXHfCPdE).

There are a variety of conventional ways to visualize data---tables, histograms, bar graphs, etc. Now that your data have been managed, it is time to graph your variables one at a time and examine both center and spread.

# Instructions
Include univariate graphs of your two main constructs. These main constructs, or variables, should be managed (from GP.D).

- Each graph should contain clearly labeled x-axes, y-axes, and, if applicable, legends.
- Each figure should also have a caption below it.

Write a few sentences describing what your graphs reveal in terms of shape, spread, and center (if variable is quantitative) and most/least frequent categories if variable is categorical.

**Submit the graphs and descriptions as a PDF file on Canvas.**
