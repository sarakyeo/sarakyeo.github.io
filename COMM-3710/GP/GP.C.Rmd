# Resources
It is important that you examine the existing literature on your topic or relationship/association of interest. This will allow you to understand what researchers have already studied on your topic.

Your ultimate objective is to go beyond what is already known through your project in this course. In order to achieve this, you must familiarize yourself with what researchers have studied.

Start by watching [Video 03 on Literature Reviews](https://youtu.be/ZmkUvbX-qlI).

Other resources:
- [COMM 3710 research guide from the Marriott Library](https://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/communication/quantitative)
- [Zotero research guide from the Marriot Library](https://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/zotero/home)
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)
- [Choosing a citation manager](https://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/citationmanager)

# Instructions 
1. Describe the association or topic that you have decided to examine in more detail than you did in GP.B and list key words you found helpful in your search.
      - Note that you may find that you need to add more questions/variables to your group's personal codebook. Feel free to do so, but do **not** add the questions to your submission for this assignment.

<br> 

2. Include a reference list of at least **5 peer-reviewed journal articles in APA format** that your group has found and read.
      - To find references, start with the resources available through the [Marriott Library](https://lib.utah.edu/). You can also use this [Campus Guide](https://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/communication/quantitative) created by librarian [Dale Larsen](mailto: dale.larsen@utah.edu).

      - You should also read about APA format in the Marriott Library guide to [styles and citation manuals](https://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/style).
      - If you want to use Zotero, this [research guide from the Marriot Library](https://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/zotero/home) will help you get started.
      - If you want to use a different reference manager, start by [choosing a citation manager](https://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/citationmanager).

3. Clearly list your research questions or hypotheses (from GP.B) and describe findings and interesting themes in the peer-reviewed journal articles that you have uncovered beneath each research question. Be brief and use bullet points. Be sure to include citations in APA format.
