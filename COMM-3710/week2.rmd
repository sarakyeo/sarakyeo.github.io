# The Scientific Method
The basic process of conducting research is the same between the physical sciences and social science. This process is derived from the **scientific method** and was first used by a Muslim scholar who lived in modern-day Iraq, Ibn al-Haytham.

Ibn al-Haytham wrote the Book of Optics in which he described the method that eventually became the basis of the modern scientific method. The scientific method was subsequently refined by other scientists, including Ren√© Descartes, Isaac Newton, David Hume, and Karl Popper.

The scientific method consists of 7 basic steps:

1. Observation (which often inspires scientists to study a specific topic)
2. Stating of the scientific problem
3. Formulating a hypothesis
4. Testing the hypothesis through observation
5. Analyzing the data
6. Interpreting data and forming conclusions
7. Publishing research

# The Wheel of Science Revisited {.tabset .tabset-fade}

In [Week 1](https://sarakyeo.github.io/COMM-3710/week1.html#The_Wheel_of_Science), we discussed inductive and deductive reasoning. Let's now turn to other terms in the wheel of science. Click on the tabs below to learn about the terms, *theory*, *hypothesis*, *observation*, and *empirical generalization*.

## Theory

## Hypothesis
<center>
<img src="https://sarakyeo.github.io/images/hypothesis.png"/>
</center>

**Antecedent propositions** can be thought of as `IF` statements.

**Consequent propositions** can be thought of as `THEN` statements.

<br>
<center>
<font size="4">IF antecedent is true, THEN consequent is true.</font>

<br>

Once we have antecedent and consequent propositions, we can build an **argument**. The video below explains how propositions and arguments fit into the concept of a **hypothesis** and provides some examples:

## Observation
The most concrete concept in our wheel of science is observation. These observations are the actual measurements.

It is important to note that measurement in social science, like in most other sciences, is not exact. It would be difficult to imagine exact measurement of people's attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, and values! In other words, there is always some degree of error in measurement.

</center>

When we consider "empirical" observations, we mean that these observations must be measurable--something that we can sense (or that instruments we use can be sensed).

Our observations should also be as objective as possible, i.e., as unbiased by us (the researchers) or external influences as it is possible to be.

And lastly, observations must be controlled. This guards against **spurious relationships**. A spurious relationship is a coincidental relationship caused by an unobserved variable.

Consider the following example:

Researchers in education are studying students aged 6-12 years old. The researchers measure and track students' shoe size and math skill in the children in the study. They find that there is a positive correlation between shoe size and math skill. In other words, larger shoe sizes are correlated with better math skills, and vice versa. This relationship can be shown as follows:

</center>
<br>

Of course, we know that this relationship is coincidental! As children get older, they tend to get more educated and, as a consequence, their math skills improve. The actual relationship, therefore, is more like:

<center>
<img src="https://sarakyeo.github.io/images/spurious2.PNG"/>
</center>
<br>

The **spurious relationship** in this example is that between *shoe size* and *math skill*:

</center>

<br>

Here are some other examples of spurious relationships--see if you can figure out what the unobserved variable is that affects both variables in the spurious relationship.

- Amount of ice cream sold $\longleftrightarrow$ deaths by drowning
- Height of daughters $\longleftrightarrow$ height of sons
- Number of religious places $\longleftrightarrow$ number of homicides

## Empirical Generalization
**Empirical generalization** is the process of describing phenomena based on our observations. When we make empirical generalizations, we ask ourselves: "How does what is going on in our sample describe what is happening in the real world?"

The process of empirical generalization allows us to refine theory and extend the phenomena that we observe in a sample to the real world.

<font size="4">sample $\longrightarrow$ real world</font>
</center>
<br>

When we engage in empirical generalization, the limitations of our observations are important. As quantitative researchers, we cannot offer explanations for human behavior/attitudes/other phenomena that are beyond the scope of our observations.

Before we discuss some common problems with empirical generalization, we first need to understand units of observation and analysis.

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

### Units of Analysis
The units of analysis and observation are the **what or whom being studied**.

**Units of observation** refer to the units in data collection (e.g., individuals).

**Units of analysis** refer to the units used in data analysis (e.g., individuals could be grouped by age or sex). We draw conclusions about a sample or make empirical generalizations from a sample based on our units of analysis.

For example, if I was curious about classes in the Department of Communication at the U, I might collect data from individual students and group them into classes when I analyze the data. The figure below shows how conclusions (called "Sample Statements" in the figure) are related to the units of analysis.

### Common Problems in Empirical Generalizations{.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Hasty Generalizations
As researchers, we should avoid making hasty generalizations. Insufficient evidence is the most common cause of poor generalizations.

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

#### Ecological Fallacy
An **ecological fallacy** occurs when researchers make generalizations about individuals based on the groups to which the individuals belong. At its core, this is a problem with the units of analysis and observation.

<u>Example</u>: A researcher observes that cities with large minority populations have higher crime rates than cities with smaller minority populations. The researcher concludes that minorities commit crimes.

This is an example of an ecological fallacy--the researcher has made a generalization about individuals ("Minorities commit crimes") based on group data ("Cities with large minority populations have high crime rates"). The conclusion refers to individuals (minorities) even though the premise is about a unit larger than the individual (cities).

#### Exception Fallacy
An **exception fallacy** is a generalization about a group based on an individual or a small number of individuals. Exception fallacies are often the bases of a concept with which you might be familiar, stereotypes.

<u>Example</u>: The Green Bay Packers will win the next Super Bowl because their quarterback is Aaron Rodgers.

This statement is an exception fallacy because we are making a generalization about a team (group) based on a single individual. Of course, there are other factors that play roles in whether football teams win.
