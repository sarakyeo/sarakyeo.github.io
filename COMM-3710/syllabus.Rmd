Hybrid | Fall 2021 | Department of Communication | University of Utah

# Course Outline
This **hybrid course** is a basic research methods course for those with little or no experience or course work in quantitative communication research. COMM 3710 is a quantitative intensive (QI) course. The goal of this course is to provide you with a critical framework for evaluating social science research and some hands-on experience in the process of conducting empirical investigations.

> Lecture content will be online while lab sections will be in-person (see [Course Requirements]).

We will examine how research questions are developed into a research project. Additionally, we will learn how to select appropriate research techniques, measure concepts, draw samples, interpret results, and communicate our research.

Key topics include:

* Formalizing hypotheses and research questions grounded in theory
* Testing hypotheses and research questions
* Conceptual and operational definitions
* Measurement, sampling, and research design
* Data analysis in communication research

I expect you to log into the course Canvas website regularly (**at least 3-5 times per week**), complete and submit work on time, and ask questions if you need help.

# Teaching Assistants
There are two graduate teaching assistants (TAs) in this course. Each graduate TA will be leading two lab sections.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)

Section <- c("002", "003", "004", "005")
TA <- c("Alexis Vega", "Alexis Vega", "Yi Liao", "Yi Liao")
Day <- c("Wed", "Wed", "Fri", "Fri")
Time <- c("8:35 - 9:25 am", "9:40 - 10:30 am", "8:35 - 9:25 am", "9:40 - 10:30 am")

# Course Requirements {.tabset .tabset-fade}
Course grades will be based on the following:

- Quizzes (30%)
- Individual lab assignments (50%)
- Lab attendance (20%)

## Quizzes (100 pts)
Quizzes will be administered on Canvas. All quizzes will be based on assigned readings and lectures. **Under no circumstances will make-up or late quizzes be administered**. You have until the end of the week to complete each quiz. There are 13 quizzes, each worth 10 points. Your lowest score will be dropped at the end of the semester.

You will have **12 minutes** to complete your quiz. Note that you only have **one attempt** at each quiz--please do not start a quiz unless you are ready to complete it.

**Quizzes will open on Mondays at 12:00 am and are due on the Saturdays of that week at 11:59 pm.**

---

## Individual Lab Assignments (90 pts)
There are 9 individual assignments. Information on individual assignments will be provided on Canvas. **Late assignments will not be accepted**.

---

## Lab Attendance
This course has two graduate [teaching assistants] for four lab sections. When you enrolled in this course, you selected a lab section to attend. You must attend at least **6 labs throughout the semester. You must attend the lab section in which you are enrolled**.

If you show up to a lab section in which you are not enrolled, your attendance will not count toward your grade.

---

# Week 6 Participation Checkpoint
In addition to the [course requirements], there will be a participation checkpoint in Week 6.

**At the end of Week 6, any students who have not demonstrated regular participation may not proceed in the class and will not be permitted to pass the course.**

- "Regular participation” as a student is defined as earning at least 50\% of the possible points on required graded content up to this point (Week 6).
- The checkpoint threshold is generous--well below a failing score for this course. For that reason, **absolutely no exceptions will be granted**. Regular participation is required because each week’s material builds on the work from the prior week. If you are not meeting this standard by this point in the course, it is too late to “catch up.”
- I urge non-participants to withdraw from the course to avoid receiving a failing grade (see the Academic Calendar for withdrawal deadlines). **Any future work such students might choose to submit will not be evaluated**.

</center>

Information on the grade points assigned to letter grades and how to calculate your GPA can be found [here](https://advising.utah.edu/academic-standards/gpa-calculator-new.php).

**If you wish to dispute your grade on any assignment or quiz, you must put your concerns in writing (as a Microsoft Word document or PDF attached in an email; review [email policy], if necessary), clearly outlining your rationale. These concerns must be presented to your instructor within one week of receiving your grade.**

You can and should check your grade regularly on Canvas. You can also use Canvas to calculate “what-if” scores and determine the score you need to get to do well in this class.

# Course Policies {.tabset .tabset-fade #policies}
By enrolling in this course, you agree to:

1. respect all members of the course;
2. engage with the online content meaningfully;
3. meet the requirements of this course; and
4. abide by the course policies outlined below.

This list represents the **minimal standards** to make the course a productive learning space. **Your final grade may be reduced by 1% each time you engage in disruptive and/or disrespectful behaviors**.

## Email Policy
> It is critical that you check your University email account frequently and that you use your University email account to contact me.

**I will not respond to emails originating from a non-University account (e.g., Google, Yahoo, etc.)**. Using a non-University account runs the risk of your message being diverted to Spam and your message may not reach me in a timely fashion, if at all. Emails should be written clearly and professionally with correct spelling and grammar. **Emails that do not conform to these rules will not receive a response**.

When you contact me, I expect you to be professional in your communication. This includes:

- Providing a relevant description or statement in the email subject line. Do not leave the subject line blank or simply write, "Hi."
- Providing your full name, uNID, and class section in the message.
- Using appropriate salutations (e.g., Dr. or Prof. Yeo).
- Using paragraphs, not just long blocks of text.
- Proofreading your writing.
- Providing a clear description of your problem and all relevant information.
- Being polite in your emails. For example, you should end your messages with a signature, such as "sincerely," "regards," or "thank you."

## Course Civility
Communication allows us to engage with others and broaden our perspectives. How we discuss concepts, in the physical or virtual classroom, is part of that process. Diverse perspectives and experiences will inform and enhance our discussions. Each member of the class is expected to foster a respectful, generous, and supportive environment that makes room for productive difference and reasoned debate. Spirited discussion is encouraged. However, incivility is a different story entirely.

Here is the basic etiquette that will be expected in the course:

- Always address your classmates by name. There is a human being on the other side of the screen/room who also has struggles, doubts, and bad days.
- Disagreement is encouraged! Approach differences in a manner that seeks clarity and better understanding by asking productive questions and by providing counterarguments that are supported with evidence. 
- Anytime you have a strong emotional reaction to something, pause before responding. Always seek to provide an argument that is supported by **credible evidence** based on the concepts discussed in this course.

---

## Academic Misconduct
> Academic misconduct will be punished to the fullest extent possible.

You are responsible for understanding what constitutes academic misconduct (see [Policy 6-400](http://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-400.php)). Anyone found guilty of academic misconduct should expect to fail this course.

In addition, academic misconduct may result in other penalties deemed appropriate by the university. Your rights and responsibilities are outlined in Policy 6-400, the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities. You are responsible for obeying [Policy 6-400](http://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-400.php). Ignorance of the policy is not an excuse.

---

## Curriculum Accommodations
Curriculum accommodations take two forms—scheduling and content accommodations. I will consider scheduling accommodations on a case-by-case basis for those who have conflicts that involve religious observances, University-sanctioned activities, and personal or medical emergencies, **if you submit the appropriate documentation in advance of the conflict**. If you anticipate a scheduling conflict, please speak with me as soon as possible. Without exception, it is your responsibility to plan for any scheduling conflict.

**There will be no content accommodations in this course**. The material has been selected for its pedagogical value in relation to the concepts we are engaging. It is your responsibility to review the course materials to be sure that this is a course you wish to take. More information on the University’s accommodation policy can be found in [Policy 6-100](https://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-100.php).

---

## Emergency Plan
In the event of a University-wide emergency which prevents face-to-face meetings, students should continue to stay current with our schedule as posted in this syllabus and to attend to the course website on Canvas. Information about the status of assignments and other course work due during this period will be addressed on Canvas and, if necessary, by way of email.

## Undocumented Student Support
Immigration is a complex phenomenon with broad impact—those who are directly affected by it, as well as those who are indirectly affected by their relationships with family members, friends, and loved ones. If your immigration status presents obstacles to engaging in specific activities or fulfilling specific course criteria, confidential arrangements may be requested from the Dream Center.

Arrangements with the Dream Center will not jeopardize your student status, your financial aid, or any other part of your residence. The Dream Center offers a wide range of resources to support undocumented students (with and without DACA) as well as students from mixed-status families. To learn more, please contact the Dream Center at 801-213-3697 or visit [dream.utah.edu](http://dream.utah.edu/).
