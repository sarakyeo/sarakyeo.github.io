# Course Outline
This **asynchronous online course** is a basic research methods course for those with little or no experience or course work in quantitative communication research. COMM 3710 is a quantitative intensive (QI) course. The goal of this course is to provide you with a critical framework for evaluating social science research and some hands-on experience in the process of conducting empirical investigations. We will examine how research questions are developed into a research project. Additionally, we will learn how to select appropriate research techniques, measure concepts, draw samples, interpret results, and write research reports. Key topics include:

* Formalizing hypotheses and research questions grounded in theory
* Testing hypotheses and research questions
* Conceptual and operational definitions
* Measurement, sampling, and research design
* Data analysis in communication research

I expect you to log into the course regularly (**at least 3-5 times per week**), complete and submit work on time, and ask questions if you need help.

# Course Requirements {.tabset .tabset-fade}
Course grades will be based on the following:

* Quizzes (35%)
* Group project (35%)
* Individual lab assignments (30%)
* Week 6 participation checkpoint

## Quizzes (100 pts)
Quizzes will be administered on Canvas. All quizzes will be based on assigned readings and lectures. **Under no circumstances will make-up or late quizzes be administered but you may drop one quiz**. You have until the end of the week to complete each quiz. There are 11 quizzes, each worth 11 points. You will have 12 minutes to complete your quiz. Note that you only have **one attempt** at each quiz—please do not start a quiz unless you are ready to complete it.

## Group Project (100 pts)
You will be randomly assigned to a project group with other students in your lab. As a group and using secondary data, you will explicate a research problem, conduct basic data analysis, and report your research. You will complete group project components in lab throughout the semester. Detailed instructions will be provided on Canvas. At the end of the semester, your group will share your research with other students in the course.

## Individual Assignments (80 pts)
There are 8 individual assignments. Information on individual assignments will be provided on Canvas. **Late assignments will not be accepted**.

## Week 6 Checkpoint
**At the end of Week 6, any students who have not demonstrated regular participation may not proceed in the class and will not be permitted to pass the course.**

- "Regular participation” as a student is defined as earning at least 50\% of the possible points on required up to that point (Week 6).
- The checkpoint threshold is generous--well below a failing score for this course. For that reason, **absolutely no exceptions will be granted**. Regular participation is required because each week’s material builds on the work from the prior week. If you are not performing to this standard by this point in the course, it is too late to “catch up.”
- I would urge non-participants to withdraw from the course to avoid receiving a failing grade (see the Academic Calendar for withdrawal deadlines). **Any future work such students might choose to submit will not be evaluated.**


# Virtual Office Hours {#officehrs}
Office hours will be held virtually each week on **Tuesdays at 9 - 10 am MT**.

</center>

Information on the grade points assigned to letter grades and how to calculate your GPA can be found [here](https://advising.utah.edu/academic-standards/gpa-calculator-new.php).

**If you wish to dispute your grade on any assignment or quiz, you must put your concerns in writing (as a Microsoft Word document or PDF attached in an email), clearly outlining your rationale. These concerns must be presented to your instructor within one week of receiving your grade.**

You can and should check your grade regularly on Canvas. You can also use Canvas to calculate “what-if” scores and determine the score you need to get to do well in this class.


# Course Policies {.tabset .tabset-fade}
By enrolling in this course, you agree to:

1. respect all members of the course;
2. engage with the online content meaningfully;
3. meet the requirements of this course; and
4. abide by the course policies outlined below.

This list represents the **minimal standards** to make the course a productive learning space. Your final grade may be reduced by 1% each time you engage in disruptive and/or disrespectful behaviors.

## Email Policy {#email}
> It is critical that you check your University email account frequently and that you use your University email account to contact me.

**I will not respond to emails originating from a non-University account (e.g., Google, Yahoo, etc.)**. Using a non-University account runs the risk of your message being diverted to Spam and your message may not reach me in a timely fashion, if at all. Emails should be written clearly and professionally with correct spelling and grammar. **Emails that do not conform to these rules will not receive a response**.

When you contact me, I expect you to be professional in your communication. This includes:

* Providing a relevant description or statement in the email subject line. Do not leave the subject line blank or simply write, "Hi."
* Providing your full name, uNID, and class section in the message.
* Using appropriate salutations (e.g., Dr. or Prof. Yeo).
* Using paragraphs, not just long blocks of text.
* Proofreading your writing.
* Providing a clear description of your problem and all relevant information.
* Being polite in your emails. For example, you should end your messages with a signature, such as "sincerely," "regards," or "thank you."

## Course Civility
Communication allows us to engage with others and broaden our perspectives. How we discuss concepts, in the physical or virtual classroom, is part of that process. Our diverse perspectives and experiences will inform and enhance those discussions. Each member of the class is expected to foster a respectful, generous, and supportive online environment that makes room for productive difference and reasoned debate. Spirited discussion is encouraged. However, incivility is a different story entirely. Here is the basic netiquette that will be expected in the course: 

- Always address your classmates by name. There is a human being on the other side of the screen who also has struggles, doubts, and bad days.
- Disagreement is encouraged! Approach differences in a manner that seeks clarity and better understanding by asking productive questions and by providing counterarguments that are supported with evidence. 
- Anytime you have a strong emotional reaction to something, pause before responding. Always seek to provide an argument that is supported by **credible evidence** based on the theories we discuss in this course.

## Academic Misconduct
> Academic misconduct will be punished to the fullest extent possible.

You are responsible for understanding what constitutes academic misconduct (see [Policy 6-400](http://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-400.php)). Anyone found guilty of academic misconduct should expect to fail this course. In addition, academic misconduct may result in other penalties deemed appropriate by the university. Your rights and responsibilities are outlined in Policy 6-400, the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities. You are responsible for obeying [Policy 6-400](http://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-400.php). Ignorance of the policy is not an excuse.

---

## Curriculum Accommodations
Curriculum accommodations take two forms—scheduling and content accommodations. I will consider scheduling accommodations on a case-by-case basis for those who have conflicts that involve religious observances, University-sanctioned activities, and personal or medical emergencies, **if you submit the appropriate documentation in advance of the conflict**. If you anticipate a scheduling conflict, please speak with me as soon as possible. Without exception, it is your responsibility to plan for any scheduling conflict.

**There will be no content accommodations in this course**. The material has been selected for its pedagogical value in relation to the concepts we are engaging. It is your responsibility to review the course materials to be sure that this is a course you wish to take. More information on the University’s accommodation policy can be found in [Policy 6-100](https://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-100.php).

---

## Emergency Plan
In the event of a University-wide emergency which prevents us from meeting face-to-face, students should continue to stay current with our schedule as posted in this syllabus and to attend to the course website on Canvas. Information about the status of assignments and other course work due during this period will be addressed on Canvas and, if necessary, by way of email.

# On Learning Strategies
One of the best ways to understand any subject is to actively try to make connections between a new topic and information you already have stored in memory. The more connections you can make between new material you encounter in this class and what you already know, the better you will be able to remember and apply it.

Our goal is **knowledge integration**, connecting the dots between what might appear to be disparate concepts but are ideas that fit together into a bigger picture thereby providing a broader context for understanding. The best way to achieve knowledge integration is to:

1. Make sure you complete the readings, actively drawing out the implications of the texts by connecting them to things you already know, have read in the news, or are learning in other classes.
2. Actively engage with the content and ask questions about things you do not understand. Respectful discussion is encouraged in all my courses.


# University Policies {.tabset .tabset-fade}

## Undocumented Student Support
Immigration is a complex phenomenon with broad impact—those who are directly affected by it, as well as those who are indirectly affected by their relationships with family members, friends, and loved ones. If your immigration status presents obstacles to engaging in specific activities or fulfilling specific course criteria, confidential arrangements may be requested from the Dream Center.

Arrangements with the Dream Center will not jeopardize your student status, your financial aid, or any other part of your residence. The Dream Center offers a wide range of resources to support undocumented students (with and without DACA) as well as students from mixed-status families. To learn more, please contact the Dream Center at 801-213-3697 or visit [dream.utah.edu](http://dream.utah.edu/).
