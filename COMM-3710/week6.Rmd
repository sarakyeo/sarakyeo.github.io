# What is Reliability and Validity?
> **Reliability** and **validity** are standards by which we judge success or failure in our measurement of concepts.

**Reliability**

- Reliability is a quality of measurement that refers to consistency. When we assess reliability of a measure, we are asking whether the measure is a consistent indicator of a concept

**Validity**

- Validity is a quality of measurement that refers to confidence in a measure. A measure that is valid accurately reflects the concept it is intended to measure. The concept of validity also extends to...

   1. precision in study design (**internal validity**, which is important in experiments)
   2. our ability to generalize findings from a sample to a larger population (**external validity**)

Reliability and validity are precision and accuracy, respectively. Using these four terms, describe the dart-thrower in scenarios A, B, and C below. Answers can be found in the video below.
