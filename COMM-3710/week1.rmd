# An Introduction to Prof. Yeo
Welcome back to a new semester and to COMM 3710!

I hope you are all well given the circumstances. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, COMM 3710 has moved online and will primarily be asynchronous. For more information on the course, please see the [course syllabus](https://sarakyeo.github.io).

I'm Prof. Yeo and I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Communication. I am an expert in survey research and experiments. I primarily conduct research in science communication and you can check out some of my work [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2043-8400). Currently, [my project on science humor](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1906864) is funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://nsf.gov/).

I can also be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sarakyeo) and more information (and my CV) is available on my [faculty page](https://faculty.utah.edu/~sarakyeo). If you're interested in science communication research, please get in touch ([sara.yeo@utah.edu](mailto:sara.yeo@utah.edu)).

# Some Highlights from the Syllabus {.tabset .tabset-fade}
## Course Textbook
Your textbook is available on Canvas through Inclusive Access. It is a great resource and I highly encourage you to use it as we progress through the semester.

Additional readings will be available as PDFs on Canvas.

## Technology
1. Ensure that you are familiar with Canvas. Set up your notifications according to your preferences. If you need help with Canvas, review this [page](https://support.tlt.utah.edu/hc/en-us/articles/205654094).
2. Check your University email account (unid\@utah.edu) regularly. Ideally, you should check this email account every day. Messages sent to me via Canvas will not receive a response (see syllabus for full email policy).
3. You will need Microsoft software (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and Adobe Acrobat.
4. You will also need access to [R](https://www.r-project.org/). More information about R will be provided as the semester progresses.
5. You will need a webcam and a microphone to participate in drop-in office hours. We will use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for virtual office hours.
6. The U's [Teaching \& Learning Technologies](https://tlt.utah.edu/) recommends that you have the **latest versions of at least two** browsers installed. The preferred web browser is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/).

# Note-taking for Success in College
**I recommend taking notes while you review the content online. This will help you learn and recall material.**

One note-taking system that you might consider trying is the [Cornell system](http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/). This system is detailed in the book below:

> Pauk, W., & Owens, R. J. Q. (2013). *How to Study in College* (11 edition). Cengage Learning.

An example of my own notes using the Cornell system:

# An Introduction to Social Science

Let's begin by discussing two broad types of sciences: **physical** and **social sciences**.

The **physical sciences** involve studying the objective aspects of nature. Typically, we think of physics, biology, and chemistry when we think of the physical sciences.

The **social sciences**, on the other hand, is the study of how humans live and interact. This includes disciplines such as psychology, communication, and history. The flavor of communication research that we will learn about in this course is a type of social science.

This week, we will begin by examining the history of social sciences and how the field of communication developed.

# A (Brief) History of the Social Sciences {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Ancient Greek scholars did not make a distinction between the social and physical sciences. In fact, many studied both and considered both physical and social processes as things to be studied scientifically. Here are a few examples:

1. **Hippocrates of Cos**

Hippocrates was the first scientist (or philospher) to classify his patients according to personality. He was, of course, also a physician--many of us will be familiar with the [Hippocratic oath in medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html). Interestingly, the phrase that commonly attributed to this oath, "First, do no harm," is **not** explicitly contained within this text. Instead, there are [modern versions](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/doctors/oath_modern.html) that some medical schools adopt.

2. **Plato**

Plato used geometric proofs, a physical science concept, to study the intrinsic state of knowledge, which is a social scientific concept.

3. **Aristotle**

Aristotle studied poetry and rhetoric with the same scientific rigor and processes with which he studied planetary motion.

<hr>

This lack of division between physical and social sciences stayed intact until the publication of **Sir Isaac Newton**’s *Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in 1687. This is considered one of the most important works in the history of science.

- In these volumes, Newton argues that the underlying rule of all physical nature is mathematics.

</center>

As a result, physical scientists gravitated to and successfully applied Newton's writings. Social scientists, on the other hand, were slower to make their studies more quantitative.

**Charles Darwin**'s theory was another point at which we see a divide between the “hard” and social sciences; social scientists were slower than biologists to see how Darwin’s theory applied to social science.

In the late 1800's to the early 1900's, quantitative measurements in the physical sciences became the norm.

Then, at the turn of the 20th century, we begin to see a divide among scholars who study humans and the **social scientific** vs. the **humanistic perspectives** emerge.

## Social Sciences Research Post-WWI
Post-WWI, we begin to see social science research expand and flourish. In 1981, for example, the field of social psychology, i.e., the study of people's attitudes, is established. The focus on social science during this period of time is partly a result of WWI being a time of great social change and people's need to understand this change.

By the 1920s, marketing agencies were surveying consumer behavior, and politicians and media outlets realized that the new techniques being created by social scientists to research humans could examine political preferences. This resulted in new ways of measuring attitudes, many of which we still use today.

For example, the Likert and semantic differential scales were developed during this time.

## Social Science Research During and Post-WWII
During WWII, the US government became more involved in social science research in order to understand propaganda, attitudes, and persuasion. In order to main high morale during wartime, the US government realized that media was critical and created the US Office of War Information.
