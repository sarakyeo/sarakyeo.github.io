# Note-taking for Success in College
**I recommend taking notes while you review the content online. This will help you learn and recall material.**

One note-taking system that you might consider trying is the [Cornell system](http://lsc.cornell.edu/study-skills/cornell-note-taking-system/). This system is detailed in the book below:

> Pauk, W., & Owens, R. J. Q. (2013). *How to Study in College* (11 edition). Cengage Learning.

# An Introduction to Social Science

Let's begin by discussing two broad types of sciences: **physical** and **social sciences**.

The **physical sciences** involve studying the objective aspects of nature. Typically, we think of physics, biology, and chemistry when we think of the physical sciences.

The **social sciences**, on the other hand, is the study of how humans live and interact. This includes disciplines such as psychology, communication, and history. The flavor of communication research that we will learn about in this course is a type of social science.

This week, we will begin by examining the history of social sciences and how the field of communication developed.

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>


# A (Brief) History of the Social Sciences {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Ancient Greek scholars did not make a distinction between the social and physical sciences. In fact, many studied both and considered both physical and social processes as things to be studied scientifically. Here are a few examples:

1. **Hippocrates of Cos**

Hippocrates was the first scientist (or philospher) to classify his patients according to personality. He was, of course, also a physician--many of us will be familiar with the [Hippocratic oath in medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html). Interestingly, the phrase that commonly attributed to this oath, "First, do no harm," is **not** explicitly contained within this text. Instead, there are [modern versions](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/doctors/oath_modern.html) that some medical schools adopt.

2. **Plato**

Plato used geometric proofs, a physical science concept, to study the intrinsic state of knowledge, which is a social scientific concept.

3. **Aristotle**

Aristotle studied poetry and rhetoric with the same scientific rigor and processes with which he studied planetary motion.

<br>

This lack of division between physical and social sciences stayed intact until the publication of **Sir Isaac Newton**’s *Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in 1687. This is considered one of the most important works in the history of science.

- In these volumes, Newton argues that the underlying rule of all physical nature is mathematics.

<center>
<img src="https://sarakyeo.github.io/images/Newton-1687.png"/>
</center>

As a result, physical scientists gravitated to and successfully applied Newton's writings. Social scientists, on the other hand, were slower to make their studies more quantitative.

**Charles Darwin**'s theory was another point at which we see a divide between the “hard” and social sciences; social scientists were slower than biologists to see how Darwin’s theory applied to social science.

<center>
<img src="https://sarakyeo.github.io/images/Darwin_origin-of-spp.jpg"/>
</center>

In the late 1800's to the early 1900's, quantitative measurements in the physical sciences became the norm.

Then, at the turn of the 20th century, we begin to see a divide among scholars who study humans and the **social scientific** vs. the **humanistic perspectives** emerge.

## Social Sciences Research Post-WWI
Post-WWI, we begin to see social science research expand and flourish. In 1981, for example, the field of social psychology, i.e., the study of people's attitudes, is established. The focus on social science during this period of time is partly a result of WWI being a time of great social change and people's need to understand this change.

By the 1920s, marketing agencies were surveying consumer behavior, and politicians and media outlets realized that the new techniques being created by social scientists to research humans could examine political preferences. This resulted in new ways of measuring attitudes, many of which we still use today.

For example, the Likert and semantic differential scales were developed during this time:

Likert, R. (1932). A technique for the measurement of attitudes (Ph.D.). Columbia University, New York, NY. Retrieved from [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1933-01885-001](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1933-01885-001)

## Social Science Research During and Post-WWII
During WWII, the US government became more involved in social science research in order to understand propaganda, attitudes, and persuasion. In order to main high morale during wartime, the US government realized that media was critical and created the [US Office of War Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Office_of_War_Information). 

In 1941, [Paul Lazarsfeld](http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/lazarsfeld-paul-f.pdf) and his colleagues at the [Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia University](http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/about/iserp-history) published the first review of the discipline of communication. In this review, they identified 4 categories of communication:

1. Who...
2. said what...
3. to whom...
4. and with what effect?

Another important milestone in the history of communication research is the work of [Carl Hovland](http://www.apadivisions.org/division-1/publications/newsletters/general/2017/06/hovland-profile.aspx)'s group at Yale University. This group examined a wide range of variables shown to influence persuasion including sources credibility, personality traits, and fear appeals.

The legacy of research conducted by Hovland's group led to future researchers examining other communication contexts. To get a better idea of how research from this historical legacy has influenced the discipline of communication, see Figure 1.1 in the textbook.

# Epistemologies in Communication Research {.tabset .tabset-fade}
<center>
<img src="https://sarakyeo.github.io/images/epistemology.png"/>
</center>

In communication research, there are 3 epistemological traditions:

1. social scientific (positivism)
2. qualitative (interpretive)
3. rhetorical (critical)

## Social Scientific Perspective / Positivism
Social scientific researchers rely primarily on quantitative methodologies and believe human communication can be examined through both simple and complex statistical models.

An example of a research question that might be asked in this tradition is "What is the effect of extreme weather on tweets about climate change?"

- Yeo, S. K., Handlos, Z. J., Karambelas, A., Su, L. Y.-F., Rose, K. M., Brossard, D., & Griffin, K. S. (2017). The influence of temperature on topics of Twitter discourse about #climatechange and #globalwarming. *Journal of Science Communication*, *16(5)*, 1–25.

**This is the epistemological tradition on which this course is based.**


## Qualitative / Interpretive
Qualitative researchers believe that to understand human communication, one must explore and appreciate how individuals at the center of specific interactions or communicative acts understands his or her own communication. 

An example of a research question that might be asked in this tradition is "What does it mean to be a member of the LDS church?"


## Rhetorical / Critical
Rhetorical/Critical scholars believe the central role of research is to examine the interplay between ideology and science.

An example of a research question that might be asked in this tradition is "How are crisis messages steeped in power and priviledge?"


# Ordinary vs. Scientific Ways of Knowing {.tabset .tabset-fade}

It is also integral that we articulate and know the distinction between ordinary (or common) and scientific ways of knowing. Importantly, the difference between these ways of knowing lies in the **process**.

## Ordinary Ways of Knowing
1. **Tradition**: This is often determined by culture. It is undeniable that traditions dictate how we interact and communicate with each other.
2. **Authority**: We also come to know things by relying on experts. For example, we rely on our doctors for health information and on priests for religious teachings.

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>


## Scientific Ways of Knowing
As mentioned, the difference between ordinary and scientific ways of knowing has to do with the **process** of generating scientific knowledge. This process relies on 6 steps:

1. **Conceptualization**: When we rely on scientific ways of knowing, it is important to delineate what is being studied and what is not.

2. **Reading the literature**: Reviewing what has already been done is important. We need to ensure that our scientific knowledge is supported by data-driven evidence, not just opinion.

3. **Careful measurements**: The ability to quantify something allows us to have an objective way of arriving at knowledge.

4. **Collecting samples**: Samples allow us to make predictions about larger populations. For example, in order to make predictions about U.S. adults, researchers often take samples of 1,000 respondents. If the sample is representative of the population, then we can make accurate and valid inferences (more about this in Week 10 when we discuss sampling).

5. **Analyzing data and presenting results**: Because scientific ways of knowing rely on objective data, scientists can spend entire careers learning how to analyze data.

6. **Ethics and politics**: Importantly, researchers and scientists must collect, analyze, and report data in ethical ways, which includes minimizing potential biases.

# The Wheel of Science
A figure representing the "wheel" of science can be found in your textbook (Figure 2.1). Your textbook refers to this as the scientific method. Below is a short video explanation of the "wheel" of science.

Next, let's practice identifying some inductive and deductive forms of reasoning. **Watch the clip below from Monty Python and the Holy Grail and try to identify the type of reasoning (inductive or deductive) used in various parts** (*Hint*: Both inductive and deductive logic is used at different times in the clip).

## Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Predictions

<center>
<img src="https://sarakyeo.github.io/images/prob-deter-predictions.PNG"/>
</center>

**Deterministic predictions**

- All data is known (i.e., one can *determine* the outcome).
- Example: Predicting the amount of money you wiull have in your bank account next year.

**Probabilistic predictions**

- There is an element of chance involved. When we do not have all the data, our predictions will necessarily be probabilistic.
- Example: Predicting human communication behavior and attitudes.
