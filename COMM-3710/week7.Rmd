# What is Sampling?
Sampling is an important aspect of research. In survey research, the quality of the study is affected by the purpose of the survey (**conceptualization** and **operationalization**) and the way it is conducted (**sampling**). Look up the following terms using the resources available to you (e.g., textbook).

- Sample
- Population
- Sampling frame
- Sampling error

> **Sampling** is the selection of a subset of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate chracteristics of the whole population.

## When is a Sample Large Enough?
If there was a simple answer to this question, it would be "it depends." How large a sample needs to be depends on several factors:

- How will results be used?
- How confident in your findings do you need or want to be?
- What kind of statistical quality do you need?
- What resources are available to you?

Often, a moderate sample size is statistically sufficient. In general, sample size should be large enough to keep your **margin of error between $\pm5\%$**.

## So... What is a Margin of Error?

> A **margin of error** is a summary of sampling error that **quantifies uncertainty about survey results**. Remember that in survey research we are making probabilistic, not deterministic, predictions from a sample to a population. In other words, there is some chance of error.

Be sure to read the following for this week: **ASA (pp. 63-68)**

Typically, margins of error are reported with confidence levels or confidence intervals.

**Confidence levels** = estimated probabilities that a population parameter lies within a given confidence interval.

**Confidence interval** = the range of values within which a population parameter is estimated (using a sample) to lie.

### An Example
```
Survey data show that 60% of Americans prefer ice cream over cake for dessert. This question as a margin of error of ±3% and a 95% confidence interval.

Confidence level: We are 95% confident that 57% to 63% of Americans prefer ice cream over cake for dessert.

Confidence interval: The confidence interval is calculated using the margin of error (±3%) and is 57% to 63%.
```

The above logic can also be used to determine your sample size. Once you know how much error you can tolerate, you can calculate the number of cases required in a sample.

Sample size adheres to the **law of diminishing returns**. This means that once sample reaches a certain size, the accuracy of estimates do not increase much even if you keep increasing the sample size. In other words, after a certain point, the margin of error does not decrease very much with increasing sample size.

## Types of Errors in Sampling
**Coverage error**

- Error that results from failing to possess an up-to-date sampling frame.

**Sampling error**

- Degree of error to be expected by virtue of studying a sample instead of a population.

**Measurement error**

- Error that results from poorly operationalized measures, e.g., poor question wording.

# Why Does Sampling Matter?
The video below explains why sampling matters, but it is not only about sampling. As we have learned, other factors, such as question wording and order are also important to the generalizations, inferences, or predictions that can be made using survey data.

# Probability vs. Nonprobability Sampling {.tabset .tabset-fade}
There are two broad categories of sampling strategies:

- probability sampling
- nonprobability sampling

## Nonprobability Sampling
> **Nonprobability sampling** refers to any sampling technique in which cases are selected to a sample in ways not suggested by probability theory.

### Types of Nonprobability Sampling
**Purposive (judgmental) sampling**

Purposive sampling is a type of nonprobability sampling in which you (as the researcher) decides which cases should be selected to a sample based on the purpose of the study. For example, market research targeting a particular group in a population would use judgmental sampling.

**Quota sampling**
This is a type of nonprobability sampling strategy based on characteristics that are prespecified. Quota sampling ensures that a sample will have the same distribution of characteristics as the population. While this seems like representative sampling, it is often difficult to obtain up-to-date information about the characteristics of interest. For example, a recent sample I collected using quota sampling matched demographic characteristics of my sample (age, gender, education) with that 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data. While it is tempting to say this sample is representative of the adult U.S. population, it is more likely that 2010 Census Bureau data is not up-to-date and, therefore, not necessarily representative of the adult U.S. population.

**Snowball sampling**

This sampling methods requires each individual interviewed to recommend or suggest additional interviewees. A researcher interested in studying drug addiction and use might begin by interviewing one user, who may then suggest other users who would be willing to participate in the study.

## Probability Sampling
> **Probability sampling** refers to any sampling technique that relies on selecting units to a sample based on probability theory. In probability sampling, each element has a **non-zero, known, and equal chance of being selected to a sample**.

### Types of Probability Sampling
**Simple random sampling (SRS)**

SRS starts by having a complete and up-to-date sampling frame and assigning numbers to each unit in the sampling frame. Then, a set of random numbers is generated and the units that have those numbers are included in the sample.

**Systematic sampling**

Select every $k^{th}$ element in a sampling frame with a random starting point. E.g., decide that you will select every $10^{th}$ case into your sample and start at a random point in your sampling frame.

**Cluster sampling**

It is often not possible to compile a comprehensive sampling frame. However, sometimes the population is already grouped into natural clusters. Cluster sampling is often multi-stage, which, in this case, means that you sample (1) the clusters, then (2) individuals within the clusters. The disadvantage is that multi-stage sampling introduces more sampling error (i.e., sampling error introduced at both stages of sampling). For example, if a researcher is interested in studying U.S. college students, they might sample universities in the first stage. In the second stage, they would sample individuals from the sampled universities.

**Stratified sampling**

The researcher first divides the population of interest into separate groups, known as strata. Then, a sample is drawn by randomly selecting units from each strata. Each stratum is a subset of the population that has a common characteristic.

# Probability Theory, Sampling Distribution, & Estimates of Sampling Error
Probability theory is the basis for estimating parameters in a population from a sample as well as the accuracy of the findings. Before we go any further, let's review the terms parameter and statistic.

## Weighting
In a sample in which all elements have the same chance of selection, each case is given the same weight. However, it is sometimes appropriate to weight some cases more than others. This process is known as **weighting**. You may have heard this term used in the 2016 Presidential election (see, for example, [this article in The New York Times](https://nyti.ms/2dXBlva)).

Read this [report](https://utah.instructure.com/files/105743188/download?download_frd=1) by the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) about weighting.
