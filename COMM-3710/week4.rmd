# What is a Variable? {.tabset .tabset-fade}
A **variable** can be defined as any entity that can take on a variety of different values. Research deals with the measurement, manipulation, and control of variables to test hypotheses and answer research questions.

A **variable** is a concept or construct that varies. Some variables are **concrete variables** and some are **abstract variables**.

**Concrete variables** are those that are stable or consistent over time. Some examples of this are eye color (e.g., blue, green, brown) and biological sex (male/female).

**Abstract variables** are those that change over time or across situations or contexts. Some examples are attitudes and opinions.

Before discussing relationships and differences between variables, we need to cover aspects of variables and some types of variables that we will encounter in this course.

## Aspects of Variables
Each variable has its associated aspects. These aspects include **variable attributes** and **variable values**.

**Variable attributes** are specific categories of a variable. Consider the variable, *eye color*. The attributes of this variable might be *brown*, *blue*, *green*.

**Variable values** are the numeric designation assigned to each variable attribute. This allows variables to be analyzed using statistics. For example, if our attributes of *eye color* are *brown*, *blue*, and *green*, we could use numbers to designate a color, i.e., 1 = *brown*, 2 = *blue*, 3 = *green*.

<u>Another example:</u>

- Variable: Journalists' confidence in their own reporting abilities
- Variable attributes:
   - `Not at all confident`,
   - `Slightly confident`,
   - `Somewhat confident`,
   - `Moderately confident`,
   - `Very confident`
- Variable values:
   - 1 = `Not at all confident`,
   - 2 = `Slightly confident`,
   - 3 = `Somewhat confident`,
   - 4 = `Moderately confident`,
   - 5 = `Very confident`

## Types of Variables
A **dependent variable** (DV) is one that is not manipulated or changed by the researcher. Instead, researchers are looking for change in the dependent variable as a result of the change in some other, independent variable. One way to remember this: The dependent variable depends on the independent variable. The dependent variable is also sometimes called the **outcome** or **criterion variable**.

An **independent variable** (IV) is one that affects the outcome/dependent variable. In experiments, the independent variable is one that researchers manipulate or change. The independent variable is also often called the **predictor variable**.

# Understanding Relationships and Differences
All variables in research enable us to understand two basic phenomena: **relationships** and **differences**. Click on the tabs below to learn about these phenomena.

## Relationships {.tabset .tabset-fade}
In research, **relationships** refer to connections between variables. Most communication studies are designed with the goal of identifying relationships between variables.

For example, Yeo et al. (2014) studied the relationship between people's *perceptions of risk related to nuclear energy* and *attention to media*.

Relationships typically fall into one of three categories: **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. We typically use a number, known as Pearson's correlation coefficient (denoted by *r*) to describe the strength and direction of a relationship. This is an inferential statistic that we can compute (and we will do so in our group projects).

**Pearson's correlation coefficient** ranges between **-1 and 1**.

- The sign of *r* tells us whether the relationship is positive or negative.
- The magnitude of *r* tells us about the strength of the relationship.
- A *r*-value of 0.8 is considered a strong, positive relationship, while a *r*-value of -0.8 is considered to be a strong, negative relationship.

### Positive
Positive relationships exist when an increase in one variable results in an increase in another variable. Note that, in a positive relationship, when one variable decreases, the other also decreases. In other words, the variables move in the same direction.

Let's say $X$ is an independent variable and $Y$ is a dependent variable.

In a positive relationship, when $X$ $\Uparrow$, $Y$ $\Uparrow$. Also, when $X$ $\Downarrow$, $Y$ $\Downarrow$. Graphically, the relationship between $X$ (independent variable) and $Y$ (dependent variable) would look like:

### Negative
Negative relationships exist when an increase in one variable results in a decrease in another variable.

Again, say $X$ is an independent variable and $Y$ is a dependent variable.

In a negative relationship, when $X$ $\Uparrow$, $Y$ $\Downarrow$. Also, when $X$ $\Downarrow$, $Y$ $\Uparrow$. Graphically, the relationship between $X$ (independent variable) and $Y$ (dependent variable) would look like:

### Neutral
A **neutral relationship** is on in which the variables are not related. In other words, it is the lack of a relationship and changes in one variable do not result in changes in the other.

Again, if $X$ is an independent variable and $Y$ is a dependent variable, a neutral relationship would look like this:

## Differences
Statistics also enables researchers to examine differences. In research, differences can fall into one of two categories: **differences in kind** and **difference in degree**. As researchers, we are more interested in *differences in degree*.
