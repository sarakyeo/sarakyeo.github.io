## What is sampling?

The process of selecting units for inclusion in a research study

---

## Terms & Definitions in Sampling

[Population]{style="color:blue"}

- group in which we are interested
- theoretically specified aggregation of units in a study
- a set of units that have some characteristic in common

[Sampling frame]{style="color:blue"}

- a list of units composing a population from which a sample is selected
- a list of all potential participants

[Sample]{style="color:blue"}

- the units chosen for inlusion in the study

---

## The Sampling Process

1) Identifying the theoretical population

2) Identifying potential participants
    - Who are members of the group?
    - How will they be contacted for inclusion in the study?
    - Need a sampling frame

3) Selecting the sample
    - What method will be used to select members from the population into the sample?

## Terms & Definitions: Representative Sample

A sample is [representative]{style="color:blue"} if...

the aggregate characteristics of the sample approximate the aggregate characteristics of the population

## Probability Sampling: SRS

SRS = **S**imple **R**andom **S**ampling

- "purest" method of probability sampling (i.e., simplest, cleanest)
- **challenge:** requires a reliable and complete sampling frame
- unit in the sampling frame are randomly selected into the sample

![](sampling-07.jpg){fig-align="center" height="200"}

A note on *random sampling* vs. *random assignment*

---

## Probability Sampling: Systematic

![](sampling-08.jpg){fig-align="center" height="500"}

:::{.notes}
Systematic sampling--determine the sample size that you need, then select evry *n*th unit from the sampling frame. Still means that you have to have a complete sampling frame.

---

## Probability Sampling: Stratified

![](sampling-09.jpg){fig-align="center" height="300"}

:::{.notes}
- Stratified random sampling
- Divide population into strata (subsets that have common characteristic)
- Randomly select from strata
:::

---

## Probability Sampling: Cluster

![](sampling-10.jpg){fig-align="center" height="300"}

:::{.notes}
- Cluster sampling
- Identify naturally occuring clusters in population (e.g., regions of the US)
- Randomly sample within cluster
:::

## Selecting a Sampling Design

---

## Non-Probability Sampling: Convenience

Convenience sampling

- select participants based on availability and convenience
- example?

---

## Non-Probability Sampling: Purposive

Purporsive sampling

- Non-random selection of units to sample
- To meet specific purpose of the research

**Example**: Perceived communication effectiveness within an organization following a crisis.

:::{.notes}
It would make perfect sense to select a purposive sample of workers and businesses in the Gulf Coast region that were displaced from their facilities following Hurricane Katrina.

---

## Non-Probability Sampling: Snowball

Also known as [network sampling]{style="color:blue"}

- Asking participants to refer researchers to other potential participants
- Cost- and time-effective way of recruiting
- Especially useful for sensitive topics (e.g., drug use, sex workers, victims of domestic abuse)

---

## Non-Probability Sampling: Snowball

![](sampling-11.jpg){fig-align="center" height="500"}

---

## Non-Probability Sampling: Quota

- Quota sampling
- Units separated into groups
- Select units to population non-randomly within groups

Example: Quota sampling to match demographic characteristics of adult US population.


---

## Sampling Error

Sampling error is error that results from not collecting data from **all** members of the sampling frame

Sampling error is always expected

- sample vs. population

:::{.notes}
Some error is always expected since we are studying a sample instead of a population.
:::

---

## Types of Sampling Error

[Coverage error]{style="color:blue"}

- error that results from a poor sampling frame

[Measurement error]{style="color:blue"}

- error from participants misunderstanding questions/measurement instrument

---

## When is a Sample Large Enough?

It depends...

- how will results be used?
- how confident do you want or need to be?
- what statistical quality do you need?

... on resources

- moderate sample size is often statistically sufficient

![](sampling-12.jpg){fig-align="center" height="200"}

---

## When is a Sample Large Enough?

Margin of error (MoE)

- summary of sampling error
- quantifies uncertainty about results
- typically reported as a [level of confidence]{style="color:blue"}

Probabilistic vs. deterministic predictions

Level of confidence

- 90%, 95%, 99% confident
- how confident you can be that the results are not due to chance alone
- often reported as [confidence intervals (CI)]{style="color:blue"}

---

## Margin of Error & CI: Example

Survey data show that 60% of people in the sample prefer ice cream over cake for dessert. This question had a margin of error of ±3% and a 95% confidence interval.

- 95% confident that the percentage of Americans who prefer ice cream fall between 57% and 63%
- If you conducted 100 surveys of the population, at least 95 times you would find that the percentage who prefer ice cream range from 57% to 63%

---

## Your Turn

Survey data show that 47% of Americans in the sample prefer snowboarding over skiing. This question had a margin of error of ±4% and a 99% confidence interval.

- ___% confident that...
- If you conducted 100 surveys of the population, at least ___ times you would find...

:::{.notes}
99% confident that the percentage of Americans who prefer snowboarding fall between 43% and 51%.

If you conducted 100 surveys of the population, at least 99 times you would find that the percentage who prefer snowboarding over skiing range from 43% to 51%.

## When is a Sample Large Enough?

Sample size adheres to the [law of diminishing returns]{style="color:blue"}

- once sample size reaches a certain point, the accuracy of your estimates do not increase much even if you continue to increase the sample size

In other words...

- after a certain point, the margin of error does not decrease with an increase in sample size

---

## Margin of Error & Sample Size

How do we calculate a margin of error (MoE)?

> Using probability sampling techniques, a poll sampled 1,000 people from the U.S. The results show that 520 people (52%) prefer skiing to snowboarding. Assume a 95% level of confidence. What is the margin of error associated with this poll?

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}

![](sampling-13.jpg){fig-align="center" height="200"}

:::

:::{.column width="60%"}

$MoE = Z(\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n})$

## Margin of Error & Sample Size

Your turn! Fill in the table below.

> Using the same level of confidence (95%) and percentage of the sample that thinks the President is doing a good job (52%), calculate the margin of error if the sample size is:

![](sampling-14.jpg){fig-align="center" height="300"}

:::{.notes}
500 = 4.38
1000 = 3.10
1500 = 2.53
2000 = 2.19
