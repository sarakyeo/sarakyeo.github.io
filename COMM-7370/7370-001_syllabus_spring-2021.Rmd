> "One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time. No doubt, this can be difficult for students who are accustomed to getting the answers right. No doubt, reasonable levels of confidence and emotional resilience help, but I think scientific education might do more to ease what is a very big transition: from learning what other people once discovered to making your own discoveries. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries." (Schwartz, 2008)

# Course Description and Objectives
This graduate seminar is an IVC course--we will meet each week at the scheduled time for approximately 90 minutes. In addition to virtual meetings, you are expected to engaged with the course content and your peers asynchronously via [Canvas](https://utah.instructure.com/) throughout the course of the semester.

This course has three main goals:

1) To offer a theoretical perspective on quantitative social science research with a focus on surveys and experiments in communication.
2) To familiarize you with data analysis using various software packages (primarily R and IBM SPSS Statistics).
3) To stimulate ideas for original research and help you conduct data analysis for your own research project.

This seminar is set up as a lab course. I will provide context and some reading materials, but much of the course will be spent analyzing data, trying to make sense of output, and linking data analysis to research questions and hypotheses.
