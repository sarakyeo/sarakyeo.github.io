#gg plot is a way to graph and plot R data
#There are several chart types available, including a histogram
#To create a graph using gg plot, first assign a gg plot object to gg
#Then, tell gg plot the data frame I'm trying to plot, e.g., 'df'
#aes tells gg plot how to map a given variable
#Using gg plot, make a histogram of age where x is is age

  #No
 
 #Is it skewed or symmetric? If skewed, is the skew positive or negative?

 #Now, determine the actual mean age of the patients using the descr() function

#Is there a relationship between age and i1? Is it positive or negative? Is it strong or weak?

#Is the relationship between age and i1 significant? What is the Pearson‚Äôs correlation coeÔ¨Äicient
#The r value is .21 and is statistically significant (p = .00000896)

#Now, perform a t-test on the data to determine whether there are differences in Physical Component Scores according to sex
#Here, pcs is the continuous variable and sex is the categorical variable 
#To do this, use the following code

df %>%
  t_test(pcs~sex) #where varx is categorical and vary is continuous; personal note: use ~  notation in t-tests

#Once you have conducted the test, state the value of the test statistic and the p-value in your R script as comments. Note that for -p-values that are less than 0.001, we typically report them asùëù < .001.
# The t statistics is -3.49, and the p-value <.001 

# To graph means with error bars using ggplot, use the following code
