Yeo 2021-02-14 Chapter 1 Introduction This is a guide for getting started and using R and RStudio in COMM 3710: Introduction to Quantitative Communication Research in the Department of Communication at the University of Utah. 1.1 What is R? R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.1 You can always read more about R by visiting the homepage of the R Project for Statistical Computing but you are probably more interested in the answer to the following question: What is R in the context of COMM 3710? In this course, you will learn to install and use R for data analysis. In other words, R is the software that you will use to complete your individual lab assignments and the data analysis components of your group projects. 1.2 Why R?2 Increasingly, data are important components of decision-making in businesses. Whether you are looking at industry trends, generating financial statements and reports, analyzing market data, or creating visuals to communicate your work, you will need to know how to analyze data to efficiently, accurately, and professionally to develop reports and effectively communicate your findings. This course will help you become familiar with R, a powerful data analysis tool. Often, students ask why we use R instead of Microsoft Excel in this course. Here are some comparisons of R and Excel that highlight the reasons for using R: 1.2.1 Ease of Use There is little doubt that Excel is much easier to use than R. Most of us already know many Excel basics and the learning curve is minimal compared to R. This is partly due to the point-and-click nature of Excel, allowing us to make simple charts and tables. R, on the other hand, is a programming language. This means that the initial learning curve is, for most, likely to be steeper than that of Excel. However, with practice and time, R becomes easier quickly and you will soon realize that R is a powerful tool for analysis and generating visuals from data. 1.2.2 Replicating Analysis Having to use the point-and-click interface, or the graphical user interface (GUI), is a distinct disadvantage of Excel. Because you cannot import or use scripts, which are a collection of commands, in Excel, you must rely on memory to replicate your analysis. R, on the other hand, is capable of reproducing analyses quickly and with different datasets. The commands for data analysis that you use in R can be saved as a script, which can then be run on multiple datasets. In other words, when we use R for data analysis, we do not have to reinvent the (data analysis) wheel as you would with Excel. 1.3 Visualization For simple graphics, Excel (with its minimal learning curve) can suffice. However, it is cumbersome to create attractive and professional-quality tables and figures in Excel. Visualization is where R excels (HAH, see what I did there!). When datasets begin to get complicated or large, R is better equipped to handle them without making errors and can create impressive and easily customizable visual representations. If you are still wondering why we are using R instead of Microsoft Excel for data analysis in this course, here are some examples that help illustrate the utility of R over Excel: How the BBC Visual and Data Journalism team withs with graphics in R The Reinhart-Rogoff error - or How Not to Excel at Economics 1.4 R vs. RStudio The image below, from ModernDive Chapter 1 is a good illustration of the distinction between R and RStudio. # knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/R-vs-RStudio.png&quot;) Throughout this course, you will be using https://www.r-project.org/about.html Adapted from R vs. Excel: Whats the Difference?
