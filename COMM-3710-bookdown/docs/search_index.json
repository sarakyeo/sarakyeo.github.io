When you head out in a car, you dont start by tinkering with the engine. Instead, you use the car via its dashboard. Similarly, we will interact and use R through RStudio. 3.2 Create a new R script Figure 3.1: Open a new R script in RStudio. 3.3 Prepare R script To prepare your R script, use comments to type any relevant information about the script. Examples of relevant information include your name, your course, the semester during which you are enrolled in this course, the assignment name. Comments in R are denoted by the hashtag symbol, #. ## This is a comment. Once you have included information about your script as comments, you should set your working directory (Figure 3.2). You can use the command setwd() to do this or the shortcut keys: Ctrl + Shift + H (Windows/Mac). Figure 3.2: Set your working directory in RStudio using the function, setwd(). 3.4 Install and load packages Next, you need to install and load the R packages (see 2.3.5) you will be using for this R session. Refer to section 2.3.5 for the commands for installing and loading packages. 3.5 Saving your R script Be sure to save your work often. You are likely familiar with file types like .docx (Word documents), .pdf (PDF documents), and .txt (text files). If you have not worked with R prior to enrolling in this course, you may not have encountered files with the extension .R. Files with a .R extension are known as R scripts. As noted in Section 2.3.1, a R script is simply a text file containing a set of commands and comments. To save your script, click the icon in RStudio (Figure 3.3). Give the file a sensible name and click Save. The file will be saved as .R in your working directory. Figure 3.3: Saving your R script in RStudio. "]]
