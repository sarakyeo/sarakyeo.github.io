Yeo Prof. Ye Sun 2021-02-15 Chapter 1 Introduction This is a guide for getting started and using R and RStudio in COMM 3710: Introduction to Quantitative Communication Research in the Department of Communication at the University of Utah. 1.1 What is R? R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.1 You can always read more about R by visiting the homepage of the R Project for Statistical Computing but you are probably more interested in the answer to the following question: What is R in the context of COMM 3710? In this course, you will learn to install and use R for data analysis. In other words, R is the software that you will use to complete your individual lab assignments and the data analysis components of your group projects. 1.2 Why R?2 Increasingly, data are important components of decision-making in businesses. Whether you are looking at industry trends, generating financial statements and reports, analyzing market data, or creating visuals to communicate your work, you will need to know how to analyze data to efficiently, accurately, and professionally to develop reports and effectively communicate your findings. This course will help you become familiar with R, a powerful data analysis tool. Often, students ask why we use R instead of Microsoft Excel in this course. Here are some comparisons of R and Excel that highlight the reasons for using R: 1.2.1 Ease of Use There is little doubt that Excel is much easier to use than R. Most of us already know many Excel basics and the learning curve is minimal compared to R. This is partly due to the point-and-click nature of Excel, allowing us to make simple charts and tables. R, on the other hand, is a programming language. This means that the initial learning curve is, for most, likely to be steeper than that of Excel. However, with practice and time, R becomes easier quickly and you will soon realize that R is a powerful tool for analysis and generating visuals from data. 1.2.2 Replicating Analysis Having to use the point-and-click interface, or the graphical user interface (GUI), is a distinct disadvantage of Excel. Because you cannot import or use scripts, which are a collection of commands, in Excel, you must rely on memory to replicate your analysis. R, on the other hand, is capable of reproducing analyses quickly and with different datasets. The commands for data analysis that you use in R can be saved as a script, which can then be run on multiple datasets. In other words, when we use R for data analysis, we do not have to reinvent the (data analysis) wheel as you would with Excel. 1.2.3 Visualization For simple graphics, Excel (with its minimal learning curve) can suffice. However, it is cumbersome to create attractive and professional-quality tables and figures in Excel. Visualization is where R excels (HAH, see what I did there!). When datasets begin to get complicated or large, R is better equipped to handle them without making errors and can create impressive and easily customizable visual representations. If you are still wondering why we are using R instead of Microsoft Excel for data analysis in this course, here are some examples that help illustrate the utility of R over Excel: How the BBC Visual and Data Journalism team works with graphics in R The Reinhart-Rogoff error - or How Not to Excel at Economics 1.3 R vs. RStudio Figure 1.1, from ModernDive Chapter 1 is a good illustration of the distinction between R and RStudio (Ismay and Kim 2021). Figure 1.1: Analogy of the difference between R and RStudio. Source: ModernDive Chapter 1. Throughout this course, you will be using R via RStudio. This means that you will need to have both R and RStudio installed on your computer. New users often confuse R and RStudio. The analogy makes it clear that one cannot be functional without the other. Just like the dashboard of a car would not be functional without the engine and vice versa, RStudio and R are not functional without each other. Remember that R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio, on the other hand, is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface and adds convenient features. Just like your dashboard has an odometer, navigation system, etc., that makes driving easier, using RStudios interface makes statistical computing using R much easier. Part of this video by Andy Field describes the difference between R and RStudio. This video will also show you how to install R and RStudio, which are covered in Chapter ??. References "],["start.html", "Chapter 2 Getting Started with R 2.1 Installing R 2.2 Installing RStudio 2.3 How do I use R? 2.4 Learning by doing", " Chapter 2 Getting Started with R Remember that you need both R and RStudio. Follow the instructions below to install both programs (also known as applications). 2.1 Installing R On a web browser, navigate to https://cloud.r-project.org/. If you are a Windows user: Click on Download R for Windows, then click on base, then click on the Download link. If you are macOS user: Click on Download R for (Mac) OS X, then under Latest release: click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of February 14, 2021, is R-4.0.3. If you are a Linux user: Click on Download R for Linux and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup. 2.2 Installing RStudio On a web browser, go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Scroll down to All Installers. Download and install the version of RStudio that corresponds to your operating system. When you are ready to use R, you will open RStudio. In this course, you will rarely, if ever, need to use base R. Figure 2.1 shows you which icon to click on to open RStudio. Remember that you need to have both programs installed on your computerone does not work without the other. From this point on, when R is referenced in the text, you know that you are accessing and using the language through RStudio. Figure 2.1: Typically, you will only need to use RStudio for this course. Click the icon on the right to open RStudio. Source: ModernDive. 2.3 How do I use R? Unlike Excel, which has a point-and-click GUI, R is an interpreted language. This means that you, the user, must type in commands written in R code. In other words, this course will teach you to code or program using the R language.3 In COMM 3710, we will learn R by doing. You are responsible for your own learningthe best way to master R is to practice deliberately. While regular practice might include mindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance. (Clear 2017) 2.3.1 A quick tour of RStudio Watch this video by Andy Field to take a quick tour of RStudio. As you have learned from Andy Fields video, the RStudio interface consists of four panels (Figure 2.2). Wait! I only see 3 panels If you happen to see only three panels, please select File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. Your RStudio should like like Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2: Editor and Console windows in RStudio. 2.3.2 Some basic terminology and concepts Throughout the book, R code will be distinguished from text by using a different font. Lets start with some basic terms: Console: This is the panel in RStudio where you can view the output or results of your commands. Note that you can also enter commands in the Console panel. Pressing Enter after each command runs it, i.e., it tells R to execute the command. Editor: This is the panel in RStudio where you type commands in language that R understands. Think of this as a script containing instructions for R. You can save this script, which makes the work you have done reproducible. Objects: Values in R are saved in objects. Dataframes: These are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables that describe the observations. Logical operators: These are operators in R that represent and (&amp;) and or (|). Functions: Functions are also known as commands. Functions and commands tell R what you want it to do. Functions take the form of command() with parentheses (or parents). The parentheses are for arguments, which give R specifics about the function you want it to perform. 2.3.3 Errors, warnings, and messages R shows errors, warnings, and messages in the Console window. Typically, it does so in red font, which can be intimidating for new users. DO NOT WORRYYOU ARE UNLIKELY TO BREAK R. Always read errors, warnings, or messages carefully; they often provide information that will help you troubleshoot the issue. 2.3.4 Tips for learning to code Learning to code can be frustrating at first. Frustrations are understandable and inevitable. But with deliberate practice, your coding and programming skills will improve. Keep the following tips from McConville et al. (2021) in mind as you learn to code in R: Computers are not that smart. You are the brains of the computerit needs to be told what to do. Instructions must be clear and without ambuguity. Copy, paste, tweak. When you begin to learn coding, it is much easier to copy, paste, and modify code than start from scratch. When you first start to program, take existing code from the resources for this course, copy, paste, and tweak them to suit your goals. Once you become more comfortable with R, you will be able to recall functions and code from memory. Learning by doing. The best way to learn coding/programming is by doing. This is why COMM 3710 includes a lab component. Individual lab assignments and group project components afford you the opportunity to learn how to code and use R by completing tasks with a goal in mind. Practice, practice, practice. As with any skill, practice is necessary for improvement. Start on assignments earlyanticipate that you will face challenges the first time you try an assignment. Use the resources provided in the course to help you troubleshoot. Most students do not start their assignments early enough to troubleshoot issues that arise. You can also use R for other coursesit is a versatile programming language that is powerful once you learn to use it. In fact, this book was made with R! 2.3.5 R packages There is a worldwide community of R users (e.g., search for #RCatLadies on Twitter) who write code and bundle them into packages to extend the functionality of R. Some examples that we will use in this course include ggplot2 (Wickham, Navarro, and Pederson 2020), descr, and tidyverse. Packages in R are like apps on your phonethey extend the functionality of the base technology (Figure 2.3). Figure 2.3: R packages are to R what apps are to your mobile phone. There are two steps to using apps to extend the functionality of your phone: Install app on your device from app store. This is typically done only once. An app that has been installed on your phone does not require additional installation. Open app from device. You must open the app every time you wish to use it. Similarly, R packages need to be installed on your computer and then opened and then loaded in R (Figure 2.4). Note where quotation marks are used and omitted in the commands. Figure 2.4: Watch this gif to learn how to install and load packages in R. Note that the commands are typed into the Editor, not the Consoleto run the commands written in the Editor, highlight and click Run in the top right corner. To install a package, type install.packages() in the Console window. The argument that needs to be provided is the name of the package. For example, if you are installing the descr package, you would use the command install.packages(\"descr\"). Like an app, you only need to install a package once. To use a package, you must load it. This is like opening an appit must be done everytime you open a new R session. To load a package, use the command library(). The argument within the parentheses is the name of the package you want to load. For example, to load the descr package, use library(descr). Some common errors related to installing and loading packages, which R displays in red in the Console, are shown below: Error in library(descr) : there is no package called descr If you get this error, this means that you have not installed the package. Error: could not find function This error means that you likely did not load the package for this R session. Remember, you need to load R packages each time you open R. 2.4 Learning by doing Lets try out some commands. Open RStudio and start a new R script. If you need a reminder, review section 2.3.1. To start, lets execute a simple command. In the Editor, type: 4 + 8 To run this command, which tells R to sum 4 and 8, highlight the command and click the button in the upper right of the Editor window. You can also use the shortcut keys: Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (Mac). You will see the result of the command you just ran in the Console window. Note that the commands in the Console panel are preceded by &gt;. &gt; 4 + 8 [1] 12 Note that the [1] is produced by R. You can think of this as R telling you that this value, 12, is the answer to the first question you asked.4 Next, try: 3 * 3 When you run this command, R will return the product of these two numbers. &gt; 3 * 3 [1] 9 Although it is good practice to write and execute commands line-by-line when you are first writing a R script, it can become tedious. To alleviate the tedium, you can run multiple commands at once by selecting all the lines that you want R to execute and using the keyboard shortcuts or the button. Type the following two lines in your Editor and try running them together: 12 + 8 16 / 4 The results in your Console panel should look like this: &gt; 12 + 8 [1] 20 &gt; 16 / 4 [1] 4 Table 2.1 shows some basic arithmetic operations in R. Play around with these functions in R to familiarize yourself with the R interface. Table 2.1: Operations, operators, and example inputs and outputs in R. Operation Operator Input Output addition/sum + 2 + 2 4 subtraction - 9 - 2 7 multiplication/product * 5 * 5 25 division / 12 / 3 4 power/exponent ^ 5 ^ 2 25 2.4.1 Creating objects R is an OOP or object-oriented programming language. You can think of an object as a container that holds information that you, the user, assigns to it. You will need to assign a label to the container. R stores the information within the labeled container in the Environment (Figure 2.5), which is the one of the tabs in the top right panel of RStudio. Figure 2.5: The Environment panel in RStudio. We assign information to an object by using the assignment operator, &lt;-. The generic code for creating an object looks like: label &lt;- information Lets say that we want to save the result of 2 * 10 to an object and call it catpuke. In the Editor window, type and run the following R code: kittens &lt;- 2 * 10 Notice that the result in the Console when you ran this command did not give you the result of 2 * 10. &gt; kittens &lt;- 2 * 10 &gt; This is because the result is stored as the object, kittens, and you have to ask R to display the result by calling the object. In the Editor, type kittens and run this command. You should see the result in the Console. &gt; kittens [1] 20 Notice that the object, kittens, appeared in the Environment when you ran the command, kittens &lt;- 2 * 10 (Figure 2.6). Figure 2.6: The Environment panel after you run the R code to create the object, kittens.
