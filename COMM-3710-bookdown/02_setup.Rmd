# Setting Up R for Assignments {#setup}

## Step 1: Open RStudio

Remember that R is the engine while RStudio is your dashboard. When you head out in a car, you don't start by tinkering with the engine. Instead, you use the car via its dashboard.

Similarly, we will interact and use R through RStudio.

## Step 2: Create a new R script

```{r new-script, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Open a new R script in RStudio.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr:: include_graphics("images/new-R-script.gif")
```

## Step 3: Prepare R script

To prepare your R script, use comments to type any relevant information about the script. Examples of relevant information include your name, your course, the semester during which you are enrolled in this course, the assignment name.

Comments in R are denoted by the hashtag symbol, `#`.

```{r}
## This is a comment.
```

Once you have included information about your script as comments, you should **set your working directory** (Figure \@ref(fig:wd)). You can use the command `setwd()` to do this or the shortcut keys: Ctrl + Shift + H (Windows/Mac).

```{r wd, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Set your working directory in RStudio using the function, `setwd()`.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/set-working-dir.gif")
```

## Step 4: Install and load packages

Next, you need to install and load the R packages (see \@ref(packages)) you will be using for this R session. Refer to section \@ref(packages) for the commands for installing and loading packages.

## Saving your R script {#saveRscript}

**Be sure to save your work often.**

You are likely familiar with file types like *.docx* (Word documents), *.pdf* (PDF documents), and *.txt* (text files). If you have not worked with R prior to enrolling in this course, you may not have encountered files with the extension **.R**.

Files with a .R extension are known as **R scripts**. As noted in Section \@ref(tour), a R script is simply a text file containing a set of commands and comments.

To save your script, click the <img src="images/save.png"/> icon in RStudio (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-save)).

```{r fig-save, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Saving your R script in RStudio.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/saving-R-script.gif")
```
