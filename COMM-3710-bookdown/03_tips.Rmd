# Tips, Habits, and Workflow {#tips}

This chapter contains a collection of tips to help you progress on your R learning journey. Remember that there are many ways to achieve a goal using R code and there is a large community of R users who are often willing and able to help with troubleshooting code (e.g., [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/)).

## On labeling and naming objects

1. **R is case-sensitive**. We covered this in Section \@ref(learning-tips) but it is important enough to repeat. `CATS`, `cats`, `Cats`, `cAts`, and `caTs` are all different objects in R (Figure \@ref(fig:cats))!

```{r cats, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="All the cats. This image is from Aoshima Island, Japan. Read more about Aoshima Island [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2015/03/a-visit-to-aoshima-a-cat-island-in-japan/386647/)."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/aoshima-cats.jpg")
```

2. **Object names cannot include spaces.** Therefore, `my result` is not a valid name, but `my.result` or `my_result` will work. You can also use numbers in object names.

3. **Short, informative labels for objects are best.** Obviously, there is some trade-off between labels that are informative (tend to be long) vs. those that are short (tend not to be specific). Use your own judgment and common sense when naming objects.
