# Installing R and RStudio {#install}

Remember that you need both R and RStudio. Follow the instructions below to install both *programs* (also known as *applications*).

## Installing R

On a web browser, navigate to https://cloud.r-project.org/.

- If you are a Windows user: Click on “Download R for Windows”, then click on “base”, then click on the Download link.
- If you are macOS user: Click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”, then under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of February 14, 2021, is R-4.0.3.
- If you are a Linux user: Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.

## Installing RStudio

On a web browser, go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Scroll down to **All Installers**. Download and install the version of RStudio that corresponds to your operating system.

When you are ready to use R, you will open RStudio. In this course, you will rarely, if ever, need to use "base R." Figure \@ref(fig:open-R) shows you which icon to click on to open RStudio. Remember that you need to have both programs installed on your computer--one does not work without the other.
