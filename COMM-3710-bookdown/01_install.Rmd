# Installing R and RStudio {#install}

Remember that you need both R and RStudio. Follow the instructions below to install both *programs* (also known as *applications*).

## Installing R

On a web browser, navigate to https://cloud.r-project.org/.

- If you are a Windows user: Click on “Download R for Windows”, then click on “base”, then click on the Download link.
- If you are macOS user: Click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”, then under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of February 14, 2021, is R-4.0.3.
- If you are a Linux user: Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.

## Installing RStudio

On a web browser, go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Scroll down to **All Installers**. Download and install the version of RStudio that corresponds to your operating system.

When you are ready to use R, you will open RStudio. In this course, you will rarely, if ever, need to use "base R." Figure \@ref(fig:open-R) shows you which icon to click on to open RStudio. Remember that you need to have both programs installed on your computer--one does not work without the other.

```{r open-R, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Typically, you will only need to use RStudio for this course. Click the icon on the right to open RStudio. Source: [ModernDive](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#r-rstudio).", fig.align = "center"}

## I have successfully installed R and RStudio. Now what?

Unlike Excel, which has a point-and-click GUI, R is an [interpreted language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)). This means that you, the user, must type in commands written in **R code**. In other words, this course will teach you to **code** or **program** using the R language.^[The terms *coding* and *programming* are used interchangeably in this book.]

In COMM 3710, we will learn R by "doing." You are responsible for your own learning--the best way to master R is to [practice deliberately](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice). 

> "While regular practice might include mindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance." [@clearBeginnerGuideDeliberate2017]

Throughout the book, `R code` will be distinguished from text by using a different font. Let's start with some basic terms:

- **Console**: This is the pane in RStudio where you enter commands. Pressing Enter after each command runs it, i.e., it tells R to execute the command.
- **Objects**: Values in R are saved in objects.
- **Dataframes**: These are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables that describe the observations.
- **Logical operators**: These are operators in R that represent "and" (`&`) and "or" (`|`).
- **Functions**: Functions are also known as **commands**. Functions and commands tell R what you want it to do. Functions take the form of `command()` with parentheses (or parents). The parentheses are for **arguments**, which give R specifics about the function you want it to perform.
