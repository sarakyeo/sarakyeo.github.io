# Installing R and RStudio {#install}

Remember that you need both R and RStudio. Follow the instructions below to install both *programs* (also known as *applications*).

## Installing R

On a web browser, navigate to https://cloud.r-project.org/.

- If you are a Windows user: Click on “Download R for Windows”, then click on “base”, then click on the Download link.
- If you are macOS user: Click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”, then under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of February 14, 2021, is R-4.0.3.
- If you are a Linux user: Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.

## Installing RStudio

On a web browser, go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Scroll down to **All Installers**. Download and install the version of RStudio that corresponds to your operating system.

When you are ready to use R, you will open RStudio. In this course, you will rarely, if ever, need to use "base R." Figure \@ref(fig:open-R) shows you which icon to click on to open RStudio. Remember that you need to have both programs installed on your computer--one does not work without the other.

> From this point on, when "R" is referenced in the text, you know that you are accessing and using the language through RStudio.

## How do I use R?

Unlike Excel, which has a point-and-click GUI, R is an [interpreted language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)). This means that you, the user, must type in commands written in **R code**. In other words, this course will teach you to **code** or **program** using the R language.^[The terms *coding* and *programming* are used interchangeably in this book.]

In COMM 3710, we will learn R by "doing." You are responsible for your own learning--the best way to master R is to [practice deliberately](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice). 

> "While regular practice might include mindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance." [@clearBeginnerGuideDeliberate2017]

### Some basic terminology and concepts

Throughout the book, `R code` will be distinguished from text by using a different font. Let's start with some basic terms:

- **Console**: This is the pane in RStudio where you enter commands. Pressing Enter after each command runs it, i.e., it tells R to execute the command.
- **Objects**: Values in R are saved in objects.
- **Dataframes**: These are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables that describe the observations.
- **Logical operators**: These are operators in R that represent "and" (`&`) and "or" (`|`).
- **Functions**: Functions are also known as **commands**. Functions and commands tell R what you want it to do. Functions take the form of `command()` with parentheses (or parents). The parentheses are for **arguments**, which give R specifics about the function you want it to perform.

### Errors, warnings, and messages

R shows errors, warnings, and messages in the Console window. Typically, it does so in <span style="color: red;">red</span> font, which can be intimidating for new users. **DO NOT WORRY--YOU ARE UNLIKELY TO "BREAK" R**.

> Always read errors, warnings, or messages carefully; they often provide information that will help you troubleshoot the issue.

### Tips for learning to code

Learning to code can be frustrating at first. Frustrations are understandable and inevitable. But with [deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice), your coding and programming skills will improve.

Keep the following tips from McConville et al. [-@ismayStatisticalInferenceData2021] in mind as you learn to code in R:

- **Computers are not that smart.** You are the brains of the computer--it needs to be told what to do. Instructions must be clear and without ambuguity.
- **Copy, paste, tweak.** When you begin to learn coding, it is much easier to copy, paste, and modify code than start from scratch. When you first start to program, take existing code from the resources for this course, copy, paste, and tweak them to suit your goals. Once you become more comfortable with R, you will be able to recall functions and code from memory.
- **Learning by doing.** The best way to learn coding/programming is by doing. This is why COMM 3710 includes a lab component. Individual lab assignments and group project components afford you the opportunity to learn how to code and use R by completing tasks with a goal in mind.
- **Practice, practice, practice.** As with any skill, practice is necessary for improvement. Start on assignments early--anticipate that you will face challenges the first time you try an assignment. Use the resources provided in the course to help you troubleshoot. Most students **do not** start their assignments early enough to troubleshoot issues that arise. You can also use R for other courses--it is a versatile programming language that is powerful once you learn to use it. In fact, this book was made with R!

### R packages

There is a worldwide community of R users (e.g., search for #RCatLadies on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com)) who write code and bundle them into packages to extend the functionality of R. 

Some examples that we will use in this course include `ggplot2` [@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2020], `descr`, and `tidyverse`.

Packages in R are like apps on your phone--they extend the functionality of the base technology (Figure \@ref(fig:packages)).

```{r packages, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "R packages are to R what apps are to your mobile phone.", fig.align = "center"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/packages.png")

```

There are two steps to using apps to extend the functionality of your phone:

1) **Install app on your device from app store.** This is typically done only once. An app that has been installed on your phone does not require additional installation.
2) **Open app from device.** You must open the app every time you wish to use it.  

Similarly, R packages need to be **installed** on your computer and then opened and then **loaded** in R (Figure \@ref(fig:install-load-packages)). Note where quotation marks are used and omitted in the commands.

```{r install-load-packages, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Watch this gif to learn how to install and load packages in R. Note that the commands are typed into the Editor, not the Console--to run the commands written in the Editor, highlight and click *Run* in the top right corner.", fig.align = "center"}

knitr:: include_graphics("images/install-load-packages.gif")

```

1) **To install a package**, type `install.packages()` in the Console window. The argument that needs to be provided is the name of the package. For example, if you are installing the `descr` package, you would use the command `install.packages("descr")`. Like an app, you only need to install a package once.
2) **To use a package**, you must load it. This is like opening an app--it must be done everytime you open a new R session. To load a package, use the command `library()`. The argument within the parentheses is the name of the package you want to load. For example, to load the `descr` package, use `library(descr)`.

Some *common errors related to installing and loading packages,* which R displays in <span style="color: red;">red</span> in the Console, are shown below:

```
Error in library(descr) : there is no package called ‘descr’
```

If you get this error, this means that you have not installed the package.

```
Error: could not find function
```

This error means that you likely did not load the package for this R session. Remember, you need to load R packages each time you open R.

## A quick tour of RStudio

Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/HWnanydsBCs) by Andy Field to take a quick tour of RStudio. 

As you have learned from Andy Field’s video, the RStudio interface consists of four panels (Figure \@ref(fig:RStudio-panels)).

> Wait! I only see 3 panels...

If you happen to see only three panels, please select *File > New File > R Script*. Your RStudio should like like Figure \@ref(fig:RStudio-panels).

```{r RStudio-panels, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Editor and Console windows in RStudio.", fig.align = "center"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/RStudio-panels.png")

```
